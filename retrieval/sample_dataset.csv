13 Cent Killers: The 5th Marine Snipers in Vietnam,1.0,"Poorly written, bitter, amateurish","John Culbertson is a novice writer who is so desperate to fill pages that he intentionally tells the same story twice; at the beginning and the middle of the book, because the story ""bears repeating."" He blethers on about hippies, Army Generals, The President, the Military-Industrial complex, college professors, the Army and Navy, REMF's, until he reaches the conclusion that himself and his close associates were the only true patriots in the war. The saddest part is that he has logged on to the Amazon review pages and gave his own book a 5-star review (check it out).","“It’s not easy to stay alive with a $1,000 bounty on your head.” In 1967, a bullet cost thirteen cents, and no one gave Uncle Sam a bigger bang for his buck than the 5th Marine Regiment Sniper Platoon. So feared were these lethal marksmen that the Viet Cong offered huge rewards for killing them. Now noted Vietnam author John J. Culbertson, a former 5th Marine sniper himself, presents the riveting true stories of young Americans who fought with bolt rifles and bounties on their heads during the fiercest combat of the war, from 1967 through the desperate Tet battle for Hue in early ’68. In spotter/shooter pairs, sniper teams accompanied battle-hardened Marine rifle companies like the 2/5 on patrols and combat missions. Whether fighting their way out of a Viet Cong “kill zone” or battling superior numbers of NVA crack troops, the sniper teams were at the cutting edge in the art of jungle warfare, showing the patience, stealth, combat marksmanship, and raw courage that made the unit the most decorated regimental sniper platoon in the Vietnam War. Harrowing and unforgettable, these accounts pay tribute to the heroes who made the greatest sacrifice of all–and leave no doubt that among 5th Marine snipers uncommon valor was truly a common virtue.",['John Culbertson'],Presidio Press,['History']

Morbid Taste for Bones,3.0,Somewhat Contrived Ending,"This is the first of a series and my first exposure to Brother Cadfael. At the risk of going against the grain of other reviewers here, I was left unimpressed in the end. The book had a very promising start but then bogged down in contrived dialogue to such a degree that I struggled to finish. This series seems to have a large fan base here at Amazon but it's evidently not for me. I gave it a shot but won't continue reading.","The “irresistible” and “compelling” first novel in the historical mystery series featuring a Welsh Benedictine monk in the twelfth century (The Washington Post). A Welsh Benedictine monk living at Shrewsbury Abbey in western England, Brother Cadfael spends much of his time tending the herbs and vegetables in the garden—but now there’s a more pressing matter. Cadfael is to serve as translator for a group of monks heading to the town of Gwytherin in Wales. The team’s goal is to collect the holy remains of Saint Winifred, which Prior Robert hopes will boost the abbey’s reputation, as well as his own. But when the monks arrive in Gwytherin, the town is divided over the request. When the leading opponent to disturbing the grave is found shot dead with a mysterious arrow, some believe Saint Winifred herself delivered the deadly blow. Brother Cadfael knows an earthly hand did the deed, but his plan to root out a murderer may dig up more than he can handle. Before CSI and Law & Order, there was Brother Cadfael, “wily veteran of the Crusades” (Los Angeles Times). His knowledge of herbalism, picked up in the Holy Land, and his skillful observance of human nature are blessings in dire situations, and earned Ellis Peters a Crime Writers’ Association Silver Dagger Award. A Morbid Taste for Bones kicks off a long-running and much-loved series that went on to be adapted for stage, radio, and television.",['Ellis Peters'],Open Road Media,['Fiction']
A PATCHWORK PLANET.,5.0,A very worthwhile summer read:,"Anne Tyler's A Patchwork Planet is one of the most charming books I've read lately. In the Seinfeld mode of really being about nothing, by the end of the book you know its main character very well and you are sorry to have to part with him. She makes you empathize with him, all the while wanting to kick him for his wrong decisions. She lets this character disclaim a number of profundities about the human condition that I will go back and reread in the future. Curl up with it on a rainy day and you will not be sorry!",,,,

The Lord of the Rings (3 Volume Set),5.0,Best Book Ever Written,"Lord of the Rings is probably the best book ever written. It is so imaginative and draws you in to another world - a world of hobbits, a race of little people, dwarves, men, and Tolkien's noble Elves.

2001: A Space Odyssey,5.0,one-of-a-kind Clarke chiller/thriller,"Kubrik & Clarke - can't go wrong when they collaborate. Clarke bounced his (always novel) ideas off of Kubrik for the film, which was to be released simultaneously. What resulted was a chilling view of future space discovery and space travel.One point I loved about the book (which one doesn't find in many other books) was the downplay on dialogue. There's not much conversation, just thoughts and descriptions. I don't think many authors could succeed in doing this, but Clarke comes out on top. After all, he is legendary.I was disappointed that HAL 9000 didn't play more of a role though the book. He seemed to be in passing through his death, even though he was clearly an intelligent entity (though lacking wit an attitude). More focus should have been given to the Illinois-borne (boo-yea) AI construct.The ending was a little hard to grasp but, nevertheless, satisfactory.",,['Arthur C. Clarke'],,
Gone with the Wind,5.0,Suprised,"I honestly purchased the kindle edition Of this book by mistake, but decided to give it a go. I'm so glad I did! What a wonderful historical drama. The characters created and the setting during the social and political upheaval of the us civil war makes this book a must read for anyone into historical novels true or not.","'My dear, I don't give a damn.' Margaret Mitchell’s page-turning, sweeping American epic has been a classic for over eighty years.

To me there were parts of the books where it did drag a little, but in all honestly I've never found any of these books that didn't drag a little to me. I did get a little bored about reading how Ayala aquired the horses. Overall in my opinion this books was the best yet.

Murder on Monday (Lois Meade Mysteries (Hardcover)),3.0,Not a very likeable main character.,"I must confess that ""Murder on Monday"" was an impulse buy for me based on the cover art for the book series. I also happen to enjoy mystery stories, especially those which take place in English settings. So this book grabbed me on those two levels, but I also chose it because it was described as featuring a ""working-class mum"". That sounded like an interesting new variation on usual mystery novel plots to me. My problem came about when I discovered that I don't like Lois Meade, the main character of the series.In order to help with household expenses Lois Meade becomes a house cleaner for five households in the village of Long Farnden. By going outside her own village she doesn't have far to travel but she also doesn't create any problems for her 14 year old daughter. Josie doesn't have to be embarrassed about her mother's job. When one of the women of Long Farnden is murdered Lois finds that she is perfectly placed in her work to help the police investigate the homicide. Now, this all sounds well and good except that it feels as if Ann Purser, in order to emphasize the working-class aspect of her character, decided to make Lois basically unpleasant in nature. No matter what situation Lois found herself in, whether it was concerning her family, the families whose houses she cleaned, or the police department, she was just not friendly. Working-class did not need to equal unpleasant but that is the feeling I got. She was very often unnecessarily rude and she appeared to have a ""what's in it for me"" attitude about most things.The mystery we were being asked to read about was not compelling enough to hold my interest throughout the entire book. I kept waiting for something else to happen. Instead what I got was the family dynamics of the Meades dealing with a 14 year old daughter who believed she should be treated like an 18 year old and the complications concerning her boyfriend. The marriage of Lois and Derek also came in for quite a bit of attention, some of it germane to the mystery, some of it not. The two sons in the family got practically no attention paid to them and the same can be said for the faithful grandmother who arrived every morning to escort the children to school. If so much focus was to be placed on the family then I would have liked for all the family members to be given more depth of character. Perhaps these characters will be more fully developed in future books but they were certainly given short shrift here. And I lost all track of the passage of time. I could not even begin to tell you how much time transpired from the beginning of this story to the ending. Every new segment seemed to begin with the day of the week to indicate which home Lois was going to. I got lost. Then I didn't care and I lost interest. The writing of this novel is actually quite good, my problem is with the plot and the characters themselves. There was not nearly enough mystery for a 280 page mystery novel.Now, the family dynamics were necessary to emphasize the consequences of Lois being a working mother while trying to help solve the murder, I fully understand that. The problem is that I read mysteries for the MYSTERY aspect, not a commentary on how hard it is for women to work and have family obligations. That was my mistake in choosing this book, I didn't do any research before I bought it. I didn't realize that the ""mystery"" part of the book would so often take a backseat to the family problems. I bought the second book in the series,Terror on Tuesday (Lois Meade Mystery), at the same time. Maybe I will react differently to the changes which happen for the Meade family in that book. I certainly hope so.","De hoogbejaarde speurneuzen van De moordclub zijn terug De hoogbejaarde speurneuzen van De moordclub (op donderdag) zijn terug met een ijzingwekkend nieuw avontuur Het is weer donderdag, en de vier bejaarde leden van de moordclub verzamelen zich in het restaurant van hun verzorgingstehuis.

Ulysses,5.0,Joyce's Labrynth at its Most Complex,"From the beginning of anyone's Joyce readings, he automatically assumes a powerless position. In Dubliners, we are walking through a labrynth of short stories connected only by theme and setting, paralysis and Dublin. We see the same theme and setting in A Portrait. Ulysses, though, presents Joyce's labrynth at its most complex. Unlike other more traditional novels, the chapters in Ulysses have almost no connections from one to the next. Rather, Joyce presents a series of coincidences and seemingly unrelated events within one day. The navigation of the novel in most places becomes rather belaboured, especially &quot;Oxen of the Sun.&quot; Like the epic it was modeled after (Odyssey), Ulysses includes moments of divine intervention. However, a Ulyssean intervention is made by either Joyce or the reader rather than by a Greek God serving as a deux es machina. The plot of Ulysses is the plot of the modern hero in the greatest epic of all, life. The novel is the most intricate, and probably the most realistic novel ever. I say it is the most realistic even though it has many moments of disillusionment with knowledge that we all go through many moments of disillusion throughout each day of our lives. The characters, just as the readers, are hopeless in the grand scheme of things. Fate, rather than the human hand, controls all of us. If you feel like trampling through a labrynth of deeply insightful and, at times, awfully confusing epiphanies, then Ulysses is for you. The labor involved in the reading makes its brief moments of understanding (the epiphanies) all the more worthwile. After all, you have to go through hell to come out right.","Beschrijving van achttien episoden van één dag uit het leven van een Joodse advertentiecolporteur in Dublin in het jaar 1904, waarbij schr. zich spiegelt aan de ""Odyssee"" van Homerus.","['James Augustine Aloysius Joyce', 'John Vandenbergh (pseud. van Jan Hendrik Willem Schlamilch.)']",,
The Great Gatsby,4.0,The Great Gatsby,"The Great Gatsby written by F. Scott Fitzgerald takes place during the hot New York summer of 1922. On the surface the book is a romance between two estranged lovers, Gatsby and Daisy, but the heart of the book is a metaphor of the time. The symbolism is directly parallel to the disintegration of the American dream.The book is a wonderful read if you like the spider webs Fitzgerald weaves. The Great Gatsby is full of symbolism related to the time period, and a love story that is nothing short of ridiculous. I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spend reading The Great Gatsby. The book allowed my imagination to play out wonderful scenes with every page. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about undying love, and the lengths some people will go to obtain their dreams.","In The Great Gatsby F.

Henry Huggins,5.0,The book that started it all!,"From my understanding, Beverly Cleary was a librarian who could not get some boys to read. They complained that there wasn't anything to read that they could relate to. They asked why weren't there books about kids like them, just average boys? So Beverly Cleary wrote &quot;Henry Huggins&quot; for them- a story of an average boy who gets into all sorts of believable adventures with highly amusing results. It is a GREAT book, and Ms. Cleary introduced to children's literature some of its greatest characters: Henry and his dog, Ribsy; and, in later books, his tomboy friend, Beezus, and Beezus' amazingly pesty kid sister, Ramona. Everyone of the subsequent books in the Henry/Ramona series is fantastic- filled with humor and characters with whom kids can understand and relate. &quot;Henry Huggins&quot; started it all and makes a wonderful introduction to Ms. Cleary's world on Kickalat Street.","This special edition of Henry Huggins features the original illustrations by Louis Darling—the first artist to ever render Henry, Ribsy, Ramona, and Beezus—as well as a foreword written by New York Times bestselling author and illustrator Tony DiTerlizzi.

Just as Henry Huggins is complaining that nothing exciting ever happens, a friendly dog sits down beside him and looks pleadingly at his ice-cream cone. From that moment on, the two are inseparable. But when Ribsy’s original owner appears, trying to reclaim his dog, Henry’s faced with the possibility of losing his new best friend.

Cat's Cradle,5.0,A Fantastic Post Modern Satire,"Among the many Kurt Vonnegut books I have read, this was the first one and today still remains to be my favorite book by him and perhaps of all time. While I believe ""Cat's Cradle"" to be Vonnegut's best piece of literature he has many other great stories and ""Cat's Cradle"" works as a great introduction to his style and humor. What separates Vonnegut's satire from those of lesser authors is the wit and black humor that is embedded in every page. With the eccentric and eclectic cast of characters, notably a midget, Vonnegut is able to comment on all of the faults of the modern man while still maintaining the humor which makes the book very easy to pick up and even harder to put down once started. ""Cat's Cradle"" can be read in two ways: as a humorous warning apocalpytic tale of a man at the end of the world, or as an in depth look at the plight of man and the many pitfalls of our society. Neither way is wrong because the book fits both instances so well that it's hard to find any fault with it; it's neither too serious or too goofy. In fact it's this balance of seriousness and humor that makes Vonnegut's writing so enticing and enjoyable. If you enjoy apocalyptic stories, social commentaries, and clever and subtle humor then you will find ""Cat's Cradle"" to be highly enjoyable journey and will re-visit it many times throughout the years.","“A free-wheeling vehicle . . . an unforgettable ride!”—The New York Times Cat’s Cradle is Kurt Vonnegut’s satirical commentary on modern man and his madness. An apocalyptic tale of this planet’s ultimate fate, it features a midget as the protagonist, a complete, original theology created by a calypso singer, and a vision of the future that is at once blackly fatalistic and hilariously funny. A book that left an indelible mark on an entire generation of readers, Cat’s Cradle is one of the twentieth century’s most important works—and Vonnegut at his very best. “[Vonnegut is] an unimitative and inimitable social satirist.”—Harper’s Magazine “Our finest black-humorist . . . We laugh in self-defense.”—Atlantic Monthly",['Kurt Vonnegut'],Dial Press,['Fiction']
Back When We Were Grownups: A Novel,3.0,Did nothing for me,"A good book to me is one that I finish and continually think about the characters the next few days. This book didn't have the first character that I cared about. The main character was annoying. I don't understand why she dumped the new boyfriend (her ex-boyfriend) so callously. The stepkids were spoiled rotten. Even her daughter made so many mistakes in life with 3 husbands of various races, that you wondered what kind of mother was Rebecca? Obviously, not a very good one. She reminded me of a Stepford Wife - always giving the appearance that she was happy and life was grand, when her life was anything but.","""Once upon a time, there was a woman who discovered that she had turned into the wrong person."" So Anne Tyler opens this irresistible new novel. The woman is Rebecca Davitch, a fifty-three-year-old grandmother. Is she an impostor in her own life? she asks herself. Is it indeed her own life? Or is it someone else’s? On the surface, Beck, as she is known to the Davitch clan, is outgoing, joyous, a natural celebrator. Giving parties is, after all, her vocation—something she slipped into even before finishing college, when Joe Davitch spotted her at an engagement party in his family’s crumbling nineteenth-century Baltimore row house, where giving parties was the family business. What caught his fancy was that she seemed to be having such a wonderful time. Soon this large-spirited older man, a divorcé with three little girls, swept her into his orbit, and before she knew it she was embracing his extended family plus a child of their own, and hosting endless parties in the ornate, high-ceilinged rooms of The Open Arms. Now, some thirty years later, after presiding over a disastrous family picnic, Rebecca is caught un-awares by the question of who she really is. How she answers it—how she tries to recover her girlhood self, that dignified grownup she had once been—is the story told in this beguiling, funny, and deeply moving novel. As always with Anne Tyler’s novels, once we enter her world it is hard to leave. But in Back When We Were Grownups she so sharpens our perceptions and awakens so many untapped feelings that we come away not only refreshed and delighted, but also infinitely wiser.",['Anne Tyler'],Penguin,['Fiction']

Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book That Changes Lives,4.0,True? Not sure. Filled with Truth? YES!,"Way of the Peaceful Warrior, MillmanThis book takes the reader on a journey, following the course of one man's life and his becoming, if you will. I use the word becoming, because that encapsulates for me what this book is about. Dan Millman becomes a Peaceful Warrior, and this book encourages us to do the same. Now we don't have teachers like Socrates to guide us as well as Millman had, nor do most of us, I imagine, have the time to devote to the teachings that we would have had while younger and without adult responsibilities. But there is within these pages a story, and it is a story that kindles within me the desire to be more than I have been, and to experience and live life more than I am now.There are a few things that I really like about this book. First, the concept of internal alchemy. Alchemy is the process (legendary) of turning lead, or other cheap materials, into gold. Internal alchemy involves turning bad, destructive feelings and emotions into positive, constructive feelings and emotions, which hopefully will then translate into our actions and attitudes. Most notably, anger can be transformed into humor that can be positive instead of destructive. He also teaches about anger as a potentially positive thing, however, in that anger motivates us to change. Fear and sorrow inhibit us, while anger, when properly understood and channelled, can motivate positive change in our lives. I see much truth in both of those thoughts.Additionally, I like Millman's revelation that there are no ordinary moments. A bit later he journeys in his mind back to when he was an infant, and he recalls (?) crawling on the carpet, and feeling the carpet touch him, and smelling a rose, and experiencing so much of the world as an infant. Today we lose much of that experiential element because we are just going through the motions.I also find his teachings about the mind quite fascinating, although I struggle to understand exactly what he is saying. He seems to say the mind is a bad thing, a negative thing, and a later development in our lives that is not necessarily a good thing. Is he talking about the mind as superego? I am not sure, but he goes so far as to say that the fall from grace in the Garden of Eden involved Adam and Eve developing their minds. In some ways, this is true, I guess. But I still struggle to fully grasp it.The book ends well, and leaves us to grapple with how much of the book is true and how much is fiction. Regardless of whether it is 'true' or not, the entire book still teaches 'truth.' I am not comfortable with the panentheistic concepts to which Millman alludes, but still liked the book overall and am challenged to live each moment as an extraordinary one.","WAY OF THE PEACEFUL WARRIOR has become one of the most beloved spiritual sagas of our time. Shared among friends and families, this million-copy word-of-mouth bestseller has inspired men and women of all ages in twenty languages worldwide.

THE STORY OF THE TREASURE SEEKERS,5.0,One of my all-time favourites,"I'm 26 years old, but my library still contains some of my all-time favorites. Edith Nesbit's &quot;The Story of the Treasure Seekers&quot; is definitely one of them. The loveable siblings, who would do anything to get rich, became my friends. I wished I could go with them on their wild escapades. I've read this book several times, of course, and after &quot;growing up&quot; I began to understand some of the things which puzzled me as a child, such as the adults' reaction to the &quot;poor orphans&quot;. Still, I hope that I'm closer to the poor orphans than to the adult society they lived in. The funny thing is that I don't really know this book in English, as I read it in Hebrew, but I'm sure it's as good in the original version...","When their widowed father's business fails, the Bastable children decide to restore the family fortunes themselves. No longer able to afford school, the children have all the time in the world to devise ingenious money-making schemes: from digging for treasure in their Lewisham garden to becoming highwaymen on Blackheath Common. All too often their efforts lead to trouble rather than treasure, until one adventure finally pays off... Published with illustrations by Gordon Browne, newly scanned from the original edition. The Story of the Treasure Seekers is the first book in the Bastable trilogy, which continues with The Wouldbegoods and New Treasure Seekers. 'She's the children's writer with whom I most identify. [Nesbit] said, ""By some lucky chance, I remember exactly how I felt and thought at 11."" That struck a chord with me. The Story of the Treasure Seekers was a breakthrough children's book. Oswald is such a very real narrator, at a time when most people were writing morality plays for children' J. K. Rowling 'I loved the direct first-person narrative in the clear, forthright tones of Oswald Bastable' Jacqueline Wilson 'Endlessly surprising and inventive. But she is more than that ...

The Teen's Musical Theatre Collection: Young Women's Edition: 33 Songs from Stage and Film [with a Companion CD of Accompaniements],4.0,Good book for some,"I think this is a good book for learning musical theatre and voice, especially for teens and kids. However, I agree with a review below me; there are many songs in here that are overdone, and this is definitely a popular book. I always see people with this same book at auditions I go on, and (in my experience) everyone tends to do the same songs: Wouldn't it Be Loverly, I Could Have Danced All Night, On My Own, and Unexpected Song, to name a few. However, there are a few gems that people don't do as often: The Simple Joys of Maidenhood, It's a Most Unusual Day, God Help the Outcasts, etc. Even those, however, can be done over and over. This is great for the young, amateur performer, it offers good, age-appropriate songs that can really be helpful. The songs are mostly all in the mezzo range, very few go above an F on the staff or below middle C, and for the most part fall between a middle C and a D on the staff. An alternative to this book (if it doesn't sound like something you'd like) would be one of the Singer's Musical Theatre Anthologies, also in the Hal Leonard collection. They have three different (and are coming out with a fourth) volumes for each voice type, soprano, mezzo/alto, mezzo/alto belter, tenor, baritone/bass (I'm not positive those are all of them). There are more songs in them (I think there's forty-something in the first soprano volume) and have more obscure songs, much better for using on auditions.","(Vocal Collection).

Ulysses,3.0,My Epiphany,"Joyce can obviously write, from Nausicca:""THE SUMMER EVENING HAD BEGUN TO FOLD THE WORLD IN ITS mysterious embrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the storm-tossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.""So, we must assume that he has primarily written Ulysses for some purpose other than to entertain and to provide the kind of pleasure that would be expected from a typical novel. Ulysses is more along the lines of a textbook (in the form of fictional examples) about the philosophy of writing and language, but was decades ahead of it's time. The impact of writing and language on our perceptions of the world appears to be his true goal, with all other considerations a distant second (excepting perhaps the magnificently created character of Leopold Bloom).Ask yourself why you read. If it is for the pleasure of opening up a book and getting lost in it and enjoying the ride, then go elsewhere. If it is to expand your mind on the ideas of writing, language, and reality and perhaps to expand your own writing then this book will be very much to your liking.The best comparison I could think of was with Nabokov. Multiply Nabokov's wordplay and games by a million, but remove most of the the engaging and interesting aspects and the stunningly refined and smooth writing of every single sentence and what you have is Ulysses. But that's OK, because they seem to have had different goals for their writing, as mentioned above.Finally, to those of you who are attempting to read it for the first time and are wondering if it ""gets better"" (ie suddenly makes sense and settles down into a typical book once you get past a certain point), it doesn't, it wasn't meant to.","Beschrijving van achttien episoden van één dag uit het leven van een Joodse advertentiecolporteur in Dublin in het jaar 1904, waarbij schr. zich spiegelt aan de ""Odyssee"" van Homerus.","['James Augustine Aloysius Joyce', 'John Vandenbergh (pseud. van Jan Hendrik Willem Schlamilch.)']",,

If you pay attention very closely to how your body reacts to different foods, it will tell you what is right and wrong for it. Self awareness is key to correct eating. After about 4 years of paying attention and experimenting with food, my body has choses for me a near vegan whole foods diet. I feel at my optimum physically and mentally with such a diet. Sometimes on rare occasions, my body tells me to eat salmon or eggs to feel right, so I do, and it feels right.Science and studies are all well and good, but self awareness will always help you make the right decisions on what to eat, how much to eat, and when to exercise. This self awareness can be obtained through meditation/yoga. Most people who practice these techniques have a tendency to eat healthier only because they pay attention to what their body is telling them.You will also find many ""champions of health"" like Paul Bragg and Jack Lalane sticking to a vegetarian,whole-foods diet.

"The Great Hunt (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (The Wheel of Time, Book 2)",4.0,Better than Eye of The World,"This book is much better than the first. In this, you care about the characters. The bad guys are still a joke. Jordan makes the Trollocs out to be tough fearsome monsters, yet not even a horde of them even come close to harming our heroes. The whole thing is mostly predicatable, but a few things stand out. The last quarter of the book is excellent and contains many surprises, with the Seanchan's damanes, Ingtar, and the battle. The funny thing about this book is that is basically another fantasy chase across a &quot;fantastic&quot; land. In the first book the good guys get chased by the bad guys. In the second book, the good guys chase the bad guys. In the third book, which I just stared, it seems now the good guys are chasing each other. Will the series stop with the chases already?

At age nine, Lucy Grealy was diagnosed with a potentially terminal cancer. When she returned to school with a third of her jaw removed, she faced the cruel taunts of classmates. It took her twenty years of living with a distorted self-image and more than thirty years of reconstructive procedures before she could come to terms with her appearance. In this lyrical and strikingly candid memoir, Grealy tells her story of great suffering and remarkable strength without sentimentality and with considerable wit. She captures what it is like as a child and a young adult to be torn between two warring impulses: to feel that more than anything else we want to be loved for who we are, while wishing desperately and secretly to be perfect.

"Women, Race & Class",5.0,Prof. Davis clarifies the history of all three struggles.,"Professor Davis provides a history of the Black, Women's and workers' movements in the US and documents the many points of common contact. She painstakingly supplies an abundance of historical evidence that demonstrates the fact that women, working people or people of color can only succeed in the attainment of their own liberation by working in conjuction with the efforts of the others. She also reminds us that the majority of women are workers and that the majority of people of color are workers, and points out that the outcome of the struggle these groups face will impact directly upon the future condition of all working people","From one of our most important scholars and civil rights activist icon, a powerful study of the women’s liberation movement and the tangled knot of oppression facing Black women. “Angela Davis is herself a woman of undeniable courage. She should be heard.”—The New York Times Angela Davis provides a powerful history of the social and political influence of whiteness and elitism in feminism, from abolitionist days to the present, and demonstrates how the racist and classist biases of its leaders inevitably hampered any collective ambitions. While Black women were aided by some activists like Sarah and Angelina Grimke and the suffrage cause found unwavering support in Frederick Douglass, many women played on the fears of white supremacists for political gain rather than take an intersectional approach to liberation. Here, Davis not only contextualizes the legacy and pitfalls of civil and women’s rights activists, but also discusses Communist women, the murder of Emmitt Till, and Margaret Sanger’s racism. Davis shows readers how the inequalities between Black and white women influence the contemporary issues of rape, reproductive freedom, housework and child care in this bold and indispensable work.",['Angela Y.

How to Overthrow the Government,4.0,Much more modest proposals than the title suggests,"Okay, I like most readers of this book (I'm certain) first picked it up because the title is catchy. The actual substance of the book is much more modest, and largely centers on hammering the need for campaign finance reform. Along the way, Huffington also trashes pollsters, and emphasizes the need for citizen participation in government and in charitable activities. There really is nothing particularly new or ground breaking here, but Huffington does a nice job of gathering together in one place a lot of anecdotal information about her topics. She bashes politicians of both major parties evenly, and is apparently disappointed that the nominees for the fall elections are Bush and Gore rather than McCain and Bradley. Bottom line: A good read, but don't expect to learn anything that rocks your world. One of her fundamental points -- that the American people have come to expect their political leaders to be a pack of thieves -- is all too true.",,,,

A Ring of Endless Light,5.0,My Fave L'engle of All Time!!,"This is a great example of the wonderful books of Madeleine L'engle! If you haven't read this book i strongly suggest you do. Through all of Vicky's misfortunes she is blessed. My favorite thing about this book is the relationship she has with Adam. It makes me kinda of jealous yet I feel dazed when I read about it. This book brought tears to my eyes yet it also gave me opportunities to laugh. I have read this 5 times in my life and I don't plan to stop. Every time I time I read it I can't put it down.

It is just as great and won't let you put it down for a second.","In book four of the award-winning Austin Family Chronicles young adult series from Madeleine L’Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time, Vicky Austin experiences the difficulties and joys of growing up. ""This wasn't the first time that I'd come close to death, but it was the first time I'd been involved in this part of it, this strange, terrible saying goodbye to someone you've loved."" These are Vicky Austin's thoughts as she stands near Commander Rodney's grave while her grandfather, who himself is dying of cancer, recites the funeral service. Watching his condition deteriorate over that long summer is almost more than she can bear. Then, in the midst of her struggle, she finds herself the center of attention for three young men. Leo, Commander Rodney's son, turns to her as an old friend seeking comfort but longing for romance. Zachary, whose attempted suicide inadvertently caused Commander Rodney's death, sees her as the one sane and normal person who can give some meaning to his life. And Adam, a serious young student working at the nearby marine-biology station, discovers Vicky, his friend's little sister, incipient telepathic powers that can help him with his experiments in dolphin communications. Vicky finds solace and brief moments of peace in her poetry, but life goes on around her, and the strain intensifies as she confronts matters of love and of death, of dependence and of responsibility, universal concerns that we all must face. The inevitable crisis comes and Vicky must rely on openness, sensitivity, and the love of others to overcome her private grief.

There are several basic space facts scattered throughout the thirty pages, e.g. the winds on Neptune blow at over 700 mph.

The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast (Time reading program special edition),4.0,"Thought provoking, serves its purpose",This is a very thought provoking book that serves its purpose. The book concerns the demonic world and its attempts to destroy the life of a man by getting him distracted from the things of God. The book is not strictly Biblical in that it takes some imaginary and poetic license to speculate on what happens in the spirit realm. I thought the book was very readable and helps people understand that the daily things we go through in human existence may have much bigger implications. I was edified by this book.,"The Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis is a classic masterpiece of religious satire that entertains readers with its sly and ironic portrayal of human life and foibles from the vantage point of Screwtape, a highly placed assistant to ""Our Father Below.""

Live and let die,3.0,"Fleming's action sequences shine, but novel not as timeless as Bond's debut - 3.5 Stars","Live and Let Die, Fleming's second novel featuring James Bond, wastes no time establishing setting or character. Diving immediately into the action, Fleming sets the template for Bond's adventures to come, particularly on the big screen -- globe-trotting, exotic locales, beautiful women, and intense, oft-times over-the-top, action sequences. Here Bond is sent to New York for a joint operation with American CIA operative Felix Leiter, an ally from Bond's Casino Royale days. They are tasked with uncovering the source of the smuggled gold a Mr. Big is funneling through his vast criminal network, funding operations for the likes of SMERSH. But Mr. Big's reach, and the lengths he'll go to in order to maintain control on his criminal operations, are more powerful and extensive than Bond ever imagined. When Big's henchmen strike a lethal blow, Bond's single-minded resolve to exact vengeance places him in unimaginable danger, and his drive for revenge threatens to blind him to the coolly lethal mastermind's greatest weapon -- the most dangerous denizens of the sea itself.First published in 1954, Fleming's second Bond novel unfortunately does not stand the test of time nearly as well as its predecessor. Because here Bond's nemesis is Mr. Big and his vast criminal network, the African-American community is featured prominently throughout the novel -- and as such Fleming heavily showcases racial attitudes and language that, while it may have been more acceptable during the 1950s, is at the very least jarring to modern readers. Mr. Big fares best here -- as an arch-villain, extremely capable and over-the-top in the best Bond tradition, but his compatriots have aged less favorably, tending towards a hodge-podge of cheap stereotypes. If Fleming had managed to curb his propensity for over-the-top dialect and negative African-American stereotyping, this novel's suspense plotline, no matter how wildly outlandish, would be given freer range to shine unencumbered.If one can manage to keep the novel within the context of the time in which it was published, roughly a third of the way through the book Fleming (mostly) trades in his unfortunate stereotyping for some really well-done action sequences and nail-biting tension in keeping with the spirit of Bond's debut. I was particularly impressed with Bond's tense introduction to Mr. Big and subsequent escape, and the novel's climatic moment which finds Bond and Solitaire dragged through coral-rich waters as live shark bait. As in Casino Royale, I was once again struck by Fleming's economy of language, his sharp-edged prose that colors his narrative with tension and keeps the reader engaged.As an American I also found Fleming's rather...acerbic view of the country interesting, to say the least, but this was tempered by the presence of Felix Leiter, my favorite recurring supporting character in the series thus far. I was quite honestly horrified by Felix's fate midway through the novel, but this was somewhat tempered by the resulting exhibition of Bond's loyalty and drive to see one of his few friends avenged. Bond is by no means a consistently well-rounded or progressive character -- first and foremost he is the ""blunt instrument"" of MI6 -- but thus far in the series I've been favorably impressed by the subtle shades of fallibility that colors his character on the page. There's a brilliant, self-reflective passage about halfway through the book where Bond ruminates on the fragility of life -- and it's brief flashes of humanity, of vulnerability, that bring to mind Craig, my favorite screen Bond.While the racial overtones of Mr. Big and his henchmen date this installment in the Bond series rather poorly, if one can read this strictly as a product of its creator and the time (for good or ill) in which he lived, Fleming delivers some rollicking action sequences and unexpected moments of self-reflection that make fascinating additions to one's knowledge of the Bond canon.",,,,
Thaddeus Stevens,4.0,Well Researched,"This book is apparently very well researched -- only 245 pages on the life of Mr. Stevens and 117 pages of Notes and Bibliography. A bit dry -- reads more like a text book but I learned a lot. Knew very little about this man but after seeing Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal in LINCOLN, I had to learn more. Would have loved if the book contained a bit more of Steven's actual speeches and cutting comments. Writing not up to the quality of Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of the must read &#34;A TEAM OF RIVALS.&#34;","A “powerful” (The Wall Street Journal) biography of one of the 19th century’s greatest statesmen, encompassing his decades-long fight against slavery and his postwar struggle to bring racial justice to America. Thaddeus Stevens was among the first to see the Civil War as an opportunity for a second American revolution—a chance to remake the country as a genuine multiracial democracy. As one of the foremost abolitionists in Congress in the years leading up to the war, he was a leader of the young Republican Party’s radical wing, fighting for anti-slavery and anti-racist policies long before party colleagues like Abraham Lincoln endorsed them. These policies—including welcoming black men into the Union’s armies—would prove crucial to the Union war effort. During the Reconstruction era that followed, Stevens demanded equal civil and political rights for Black Americans—rights eventually embodied in the 14th and 15th amendments. But while Stevens in many ways pushed his party—and America—towards equality, he also championed ideas too radical for his fellow Congressmen ever to support, such as confiscating large slaveholders’ estates and dividing the land among those who had been enslaved. In Thaddeus Stevens, acclaimed historian Bruce Levine has written a “vital” (The Guardian), “compelling” (James McPherson) biography of one of the most visionary statesmen of the 19th century and a forgotten champion for racial justice in America.",['Bruce Levine'],Simon and Schuster,['Biography & Autobiography']

Death of a Stranger (William Monk Series),5.0,The seamier side of life,"This novel is set in London, England, in the early 1860s. The Civil War is being fought in the United States while life goes on as usual in England. The situation described in the novel was usual for that time period, and is similar to the real circumstances that prevailed in my hometown, at that time a notorious sailing port in the U.S., during the later 19th century - a reformer trying to clean up the town soon discovered that most of the &quot;good citizens&quot; were getting their share of the pie, the prostitutes paid in cash and were a mainstay of the town's economy (see &quot;Port Townsend - An Illustrated History of Shanghaiing, Shipwrecks, Soiled Doves, and Sundry Souls&quot;).Hester Monk (who had been a nurse in the Crimea) operates an infirmary in a lower class neighborhood, offering medical services to the ladies of the evening who are suffering from injuries and diseases. Her husband, William Monk, is involved in an investigation of possible financial wrongdoing among the principals of a railroad company. The death of a &quot;respectable&quot; man outside a bordello in the area creates a turmoil and eventually events are drawn together.Circumstances reveal a brutal form of loan sharking. William's investigation brings out information about his past - he was not always a nice person. Past relationships are revealed as the case draws to a conclusion. Overall, an interesting plot, with a good picture of the underside of Victorian London.","The tragic death of a railway magnate in a sleazy brothel has shocked high society. Meanwhile, private investigator William Monk acquires a mysterious new client who asks him to ascertain beyond the shadow of a doubt whether or not her fiancé, a railway-firm executive, has become enmeshed in fraudulent practices. And so Monk embarks upon a journey that will revive memories stripped from his consciousness by amnesia—as a past almost impossible to bear returns, eerily paralleling a fresh tragedy that has already begun its inexorable unfolding.",['Anne Perry'],William Monk,['Fiction']
Beyond Justice: The Auschwitz Trial,5.0,There could be no adequate Justice,Excellent portrayal of all of the reasons that in fact the trial could not deal with a true sense of justice.The crimes were so heinnous that the penal code was inadequate to address them.The prosection's hands were tied and a mere 6500 were charged. It was too little too late.S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest,"In 1963, West Germany was gripped by a dramatic trial of former guards who had worked at the Nazi death camp Auschwitz. It was the largest and most public trial to take place in the country and attracted international attention. Using the pretrial files and extensive trial audiotapes, Rebecca Wittmann offers a fascinating reinterpretation of Germany's first major attempt to confront its past. Evoking the courtroom atmosphere, Wittmann vividly recounts the testimony of survivors, former SS officers, and defendants--a cross-section of the camp population. Attorney General Fritz Bauer made an extraordinary effort to put the entire Auschwitz complex on trial, but constrained by West German murder laws, the prosecution had to resort to standards for illegal behavior that echoed the laws of the Third Reich. This provided a legitimacy to the Nazi state. Only those who exceeded direct orders were convicted of murder. This shocking ruling was reflected in the press coverage, which focused on only the most sadistic and brutal crimes, allowing the real atrocity at Auschwitz--mass murder in the gas chambers--to be relegated to the background. The Auschwitz trial had a paradoxical result. Although the prosecution succeeded in exposing SS crimes at the camp for the first time, the public absorbed a distorted representation of the criminality of the camp system. The Auschwitz trial ensured that rather than coming to terms with their Nazi past, Germans managed to delay a true reckoning with the horror of the Holocaust.",['Rebecca Wittmann'],Harvard University Press,['History']

Petersburg,4.0,Worth the less than ideal translation,"Nabokov, the translator's introduction triumphantly proclaims, thought Petersburg one the three best books ever written, beside Joyce's Ulysses and Kafka's Metamorphosis. Nabokov, they do not emphasize quite as proudly, was also a native Russian, so he might have had this book a little easier.Truly, this is a masterpiece, even if a little hard to translate. Imagine Ulysses, barely possible to read as it is, translated into another language, and you might come close to the difficulties in navigating through Bely's symbolist playground complete with 50+ pages of endnotes. However, unless you plan on learning Russian sometime very soon, that is no excuse for skipping this novel--certainly the lack of a successful English translation is the only thing that keeps it from joining the ranks of other great Russian novels. The fragile tale of an enchanting yet troubled city and the dancing psyches that inhabit it is well worth any difficulties in translation.","Een jonge vrouw wil in 1914 een medische opleiding volgen in St. Petersburg, maar wordt ze afgewezen vanwege haar gedeeltelijk joodse afkomst.",['Linda Lee Chaikin'],Uitgeverij Kok,
Love and Hydrogen: New and Selected Stories,5.0,John Ashcroft & the creature from the black lagoon,"This is the best short fiction collection I've read in several years. Shepard's stories are both economical and lean--there isn't much here that's over 20 pages long, but Shepard packs into those 20 pages a complexity of theme and character that most writers can't approach even at novella length. It is a dizzying collection, by turns violent, funny, and wrenchingly sad. Shepard writes in a dazzling array of voices, handling each with effortless authority. He is particularly good at adolescents (see also the amazing Project X), but these stories also give voice to a Yugoslav football player, a German test pilot, John Entwhistle, John Ashcroft, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Superb.","I’ve been a problem baby, a lousy son, a distant brother, an off-putting neighbor, a piss-poor student, a worrisome seatmate, an unreliable employee, a bewildering lover, a frustrating confidante and a crappy husband. Among the things I do pretty well at this point I’d have to list darts, re-closing Stay-Fresh boxes, and staying out of the way. This is the self-eulogy offered early on by the unwilling hero of the opening story in this collection, a dazzling array of work in short fiction from a master of the form. The stories in Love and Hydrogen—familiar to readers from publications ranging from McSweeney’s to The New Yorker to Harper’s to Tin House—encompass in theme and compassion what an ordinary writer would seem to need several lifetimes to imagine. A frustrated wife makes use of an enterprising illegal-gun salesman to hold her husband hostage; two hapless adult-education students botch their attempts at rudimentary piano but succeed in a halting, awkward romance; a fascinated and murderous Creature welcomes the first human visitors to his Black Lagoon; and in the title story, the stupefyingly huge airship Hindenburg flies to its doom, representing in 1937 mankind's greatest yearning as well as its titanic failure. Generous in scope and astonishing in ambition, Shepard’s voice never falters; the virtuosity of Love and Hydrogen cements his reputation as, in the words of Rick Bass, “a passionate writer with a razor-sharp wit and an elephantine heart”—in short, one of the most powerful talents at work today.",['Jim Shepard'],Vintage,['Fiction']

The Elementary Forms of Religious Life,5.0,WARNING: THIS EDITION IS ABRIDGED,"Durkheim's ""Elementary Forms of the Religious Life"" is one of the deepest books I've ever read, but I will leave others to speak of that.I would like to complain about this particular edition, the ""Oxford's World Classics"" edition. (This review has apparently been published elsewhere. The edition I'm talking about is a yellow-and-red ""Oxford's World's Classics"" paperback with a black-and-white photo of Durkheim looking off to his left.)I have long been looking to replace my worn-out edition, and thought this offering (published 2001) would answer nicely. (Is it just me, or has this book been plagued with editions that have flimsy binding?)Unfortunately, Amazon buries an important piece of information in its ""Editorial Reviews"" section: this edition is abridged.Now, it's lightly abridged. The original, which I have a hand, is only slightly longer than what you're getting here.Which is what puzzles me: why did they bother to abridge this at all? Printing the entire text would only have added about 30 pages to the thing. The lines they have disincluded seem, at least upon my examination, no more irrelevant or abstruse than what they've decided to include.Puzzling.There are some good things about this edition, though. There are explanatory footnotes at the end of the text: useful glosses, not those ""textual comparison"" kind. (The footnotes on the bottom of each page are Durkheim's own.) There is a 29-page introduction. There is also an ethnographic map of Australia. But the biggest plus for me is that the (paperback) binding is super-sturdy and promises to last through many reads.This is the translation by Carol Cosman, done in 2001 specifically for this edition.","In The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, Durkheim investigated the enduring source of human social identity and fellowship by studying the simplest form of documented religion, totemism among the Aborigines of Australia. His book about the origin and nature of religion and society continues to enthrall sociologists, anthropologists, ethnographers, philosophers, and theologians.",['Émile Durkheim'],Oxford Paperbacks,['Religion']

I am the black lion who helps people discover the wild animal within. I am the black lion who roars for peace and harmony on Great Mother Earth. I am the black lion, alive in the wilderness. Wilderness guide Sicelo Mbatha shares the wisdom he has gained from a lifetime’s intimate association with Africa’s wildest nature. The story begins with a traumatic childhood experience that should have turned Sicelo against the surrounding wilderness. Instead, he was irresistibly drawn to it. As a volunteer at Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, close encounters with buffalo, lion, elephant and other animals taught him to see with his heart and set him on a lifelong journey of spiritual awakening. Drawing from his Zulu culture and his own yearning to better understand humanity’s relationship with itself and with nature, Sicelo has forged a new path, disrupting the conventional approach to nature with an immersive, respectful and transformative way of being in the wilderness. Both memoir and philosophical reflection, Black Lion – co-written with author and environmentalist Bridget Pitt – is a reminder of how much we need the wilderness for our emotional and spiritual survival. ‘A remarkable story ... poetic and beautifully written. It goes to the heart of the meaning of ecological literacy.’ – DR IAN McCALLUM, SPECIALIST WILDERNESS GUIDE","['Sicelo Mbatha', 'Bridget Pitt']",Jonathan Ball Publishers,['Biography & Autobiography']

Companions of the Night,5.0,Best romance/horror/vampire book EVER,"When I read The Silver Kiss (Annette Curtis Klause), I was positive that it couldn't get any better than that. I was wrong. This book definitely takes the cake in it's genre. When Kerry, an average 16-year-old, with a learner's permit and a Mom who abandoned her family, grudgingly drives to a laundromat late at night to retrieve her little brother's stuffed koala bear, she unknowingly gets involved with a world of mystery and vampires when she meets Ethan, gagged and bloddied, and suspected of being a vampire by a group of vamp hunters. Which, of course isn't a good thing for Ethan. Her beliving there are no such thing of vampires, she helps him escape, and she assumes she'll never see him again. She's wrong. When her family goes missing, Ethan is the only one who can help her find them, and Kerry is the only one who can help Ethan get the revenge he wants on the vamp hunters. Things get more complicated when Kerry realizes she's fallen in love with Ethan, and... oh yeah, he really IS a vampire. The characters are well developed, and the plot has tons of twists. The many facades and uncertainties that surround Ethan will keep you guessing throughout the whole book. if you like vampires and romance, buy. This. Book. Now. I cried at the end, probably due a combination of the way the book touched me so deeply, and the fact that there is no sequel yet. Because, not to give away the ending, but it is wide open for a sequel. Unfortunately, it was written in 95', and we're still waiting ....but I haven't lost hope! Good luck trying not to read it in one sitting ;-).","The Edgar Award–winning author of Never Trust a Dead Man puts a terrifying spin on what should be a typical night in a small town.

"Hello, My Name Is Mommy : The Dysfunctional Girl's Guide to Having, Loving (and Hopefully Not Screwing Up) a Baby",2.0,"Stick With the Radio Show, Or Use the Library Instead","I'm not that impressed with this book. I, too, listen to Bob & Sheri in the morning, and I've always enjoyed Sheri's view and the way she gets her point across. So when I learned that she wrote a book, I checked my library (no luck - they're very slow getting new releases), and then bought it while on vacation for my long airplane ride.The thing about Sheri's radio show is that she's funny, but a lot of it is in the delivery. Her book is exactly like her show (she writes the way she talks); only it doesn't come across very well in writing. And that's not good reading, either.She touches on the basics of pregnancy and having a newborn, and I agree with a lot of what she says, and can relate to her stories. But I don't get who a ""Misfit"" is, exactly. First she describes a Misfit as a woman who had a horrible childhood, or bad role models growing up, or something awful. But within the meat of her chapters, it seems that a Misfit if Every Woman (news flash: not every woman had to visit her parents in jail growing up, but we still have the same worries about pregnancy and birth that MOST women have!).If you're as much as a control freak as you say you are, Sheri, you're reading this review right now (hi!), so don't stop here. I'd love to read more about radio life. My favorite parts of your book were the true-life stories about how you were treated and the things you experienced (comments from callers, getting sick in the bathroom where your co-workers butt just sat, pumping milk through a two-song set). I urge you to write a book ABOUT your job and how you juggle a family... I've heard your newest baby on air before (in the background); tell us how you were able to get that kind of privilege. Help the rest of us have the same perks you enjoy. You are helping introduce that kind of lifestyle into the work world, so keep it up.Barb","Hilarious and true and inspirational, Hello, My Name is Mommy is for every pregnant woman and new mother who ever felt helpless and out of control instead of confident and aglow.

The Winter Queen,4.0,A young policeman investigates deaths in nineteenth century Czarist Russia.,"This period novel is mostly to be appreciated for its atmosphere. It is set in Czarist Russia with a brief detour to nineteenth century London. Erast Fandorin, a minor functionary in the Imperial police, investigates a series of curious suicides/murders. Successes lead to rapid advancement and promotion within the service. It is the first book in a series about Fandorin's adventures. The style reminded me a little of The Three Musketeers and other Dumas novels, with regard to the use of helpful coincidences. It also resembles some of the writing of Arturo Perez-Reverte which captures the atmosphere of period Spain. Most fascinating was the description of the hierarchy of Russian society. An appendix lists thirteen ranks with civil and military equivalents, so readers do not get lost. The international conspiracy elements, on the other hand, struck me as anachronistic, speaking more to a modern paranoia. Interestingly, the book is politically disengaged. Perhaps avoiding politics and religion is the best way to retain readers. The Soviet Revolution is looming yet neither rich nor poor express monarchist, revolutionary or any religious sentiments. Apart from these criticisms it is a fine read for lovers of historic novels and international literature.","The thrilling family saga of five unforgettable women who remade Europe From the great courts, glittering palaces, and war-ravaged battlefields of the seventeenth century comes the story of four spirited sisters and their glamorous mother, Elizabeth Stuart, granddaughter of the martyred Mary, Queen of Scots. Upon her father's ascension to the illustrious throne of England, Elizabeth Stuart was suddenly thrust from the poverty of unruly Scotland into the fairy-tale existence of a princess of great wealth and splendor. When she was married at sixteen to a German count far below her rank, it was with the understanding that her father would help her husband achieve the kingship of Bohemia. The terrible betrayal of this commitment would ruin ""the Winter Queen,"" as Elizabeth would forever be known, imperil the lives of those she loved, and launch a war that would last for thirty years. Forced into exile, the Winter Queen and her family found refuge in Holland, where the glorious art and culture of the Dutch Golden Age indelibly shaped her daughters' lives. Her eldest, Princess Elizabeth, became a scholar who earned the respect and friendship of the philosopher René Descartes. Louisa was a gifted painter whose engaging manner and appealing looks provoked heartache and scandal. Beautiful Henrietta Maria would be the only sister to marry into royalty, although at great cost. But it was the youngest, Sophia, a heroine in the tradition of a Jane Austen novel, whose ready wit and good-natured common sense masked immense strength of character, who fulfilled the promise of her great-grandmother Mary and reshaped the British monarchy, a legacy that endures to this day. Brilliantly researched and captivatingly written, filled with danger, treachery, and adventure but also love, courage, and humor, Daughters of the Winter Queen follows the lives of five remarkable women who, by refusing to surrender to adversity, changed the course of history.",['Nancy Goldstone'],"Little, Brown",['Biography & Autobiography']

To Kill a Mocking Bird,5.0,Tightly written with a message for everyone,"Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur ""Boo"" Radley.Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.","Harper Lee's classic novel of a lawyer in the Deep South defending a black man charged with the rape of a white girl.

I am Legend,2.0,Disappointed after reading the reviews,"I expected more out of this book after seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews.

The Great Divorce,5.0,One of my all-time favourites,"I have probably read almost every word of C.S. Lewis' published writing, he has been one of the great influences in my intellectual and spiritual development. But The Great Divorce is at the top of my list of favourite books by him (though Perelandra and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader are up there with it).This short work displays Lewis the mystic instead of Lewis the apologist or literary critic. Through a symbolic story he delves deeply into the mystery of spiritual life and the eschatological destiny of humanity. The busload of citizens from Hell taking an excursion to Heaven are exposed to true Reality and the final choice that remains for everyone - whether to relinquish their false Ego and find the joy of their true Self or to hold on to a fantasy of ever-diminishing self-satisfaction.The Ghosts are beautifully drawn types of various forms of human selfishness. The compulsive flirt, the smug intellectual, the bitter revolutionary, the grumbling old woman, the blinkered materialist, the social climber, the self-righteous bully, the controlling wife, the besotted mother, the narcissistic artist, the manipulative lover, and the shamefaced pervert all face the eternal world, where all they bring is the shadowy unreality of the person they have become. Lewis depicts even himself as the fearful and self-conscious believer in need of a bit of 'thickening up'. Some of the encounters he describes are unforgettable. In particular for me the pathetic fate of the Tragedian is almost unbearable to contemplate and the triumph of the man with the 'lizard' inspires me with the power of grace.The story closes with an impressionistic glimpse of eternity and a hint of the mysterious destinies that it may contain. No answers here - 'You cannot know eternity by a definition' - but a profound insight into the nature of choice and the journey 'farther up into the mountains' that is the only one worth taking. This is a classic of Christian devotional writing.","What if anyone in Hell could take a bus trip to Heaven and stay there forever if they wanted to? In The Great Divorce C. S. Lewis again employs his formidable talent for fable and allegory. The writer finds himself in Hell boarding a bus bound for Heaven. The amazing opportunity is that anyone who wants to stay in Heaven, can. This is the starting point for an extraordinary meditation upon good and evil, grace and judgment. Lewis's revolutionary idea is the discovery that the gates of Hell are locked from the inside. In Lewis's own words, ""If we insist on keeping Hell (or even earth) we shall not see Heaven: if we accept Heaven we shall not be able to retain even the smallest and most intimate souvenirs of Hell.""",['C. S. Lewis'],Harper Collins,['Religion']

"The fountainhead,",5.0,The beginning of my rebirth.,"The Fountainhead, above all things, is a brutal vision of the world. I was torn by this book. Introduced to me by a bitter English teacher who had taken objectivism to his heart and soul, this novel kept me reading, without food or sleep, for two days. I cannot say that it is the greatest book I have ever read, for I have read better, but I can say that after reading The Fountainhead I could not help but think about the world, about my friends, and, most frightening of all, about myself, in a whole new light. Ayn Rand will make of the most torpid idiot, with a single brilliant, vicious stroke, a philosopher. I suggest you read Atlas Shrugged, and look for the description of Atlas, shoulders dripping blood, tears streaming from his eyes, bearing the world upon his shoulders. Rand believes, above all, in the ultimate greatness of man. A few hundred pages is a small prize to pay to share in her belief.","Her first major literary success, Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead is an exalted view of her Objectivist philosophy, portraying a visionary artist struggling against the dull, conformist dogma of his peers; a book of ambition, power, gold and love, published in Penguin Modern Classics. Architect Howard Roark is as unyielding as the granite he blasts to build with. Defying the conventions of the world around him, he embraces a battle over two decades against a double-dealing crew of rivals who will stop at nothing to bring him down. These include, perhaps most troublesome of all, the ambitious Dominique Francon, who may just prove to be Roarke's equal. This epic story of money, power and a man's struggle to succeed on his own terms is a paean to individualism and humanity's creative potential. First published in 1943, The Fountainhead introduced millions to Rand's philosophy of Objectivism: an uncompromising defence of self-interest as the engine of progress, and a jubilant celebration of man's creative potential. Ayn Rand (1905-1982), born Alisa Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg, Russia, emigrated to America with her family in January 1926, never to return to her native land. Her novel The Fountainhead was published in 1943 and eventually became a bestseller. Still occasionally working as a screenwriter, Rand moved to New York City in 1951 and published Atlas Shrugged in 1957. Her novels espoused what came to be called Objectivism, a philosophy that champions capitalism and the pre-eminence of the individual. If you enjoued The Fountainhead, you might like Rand's Atlas Shrugged, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.

The Jewish Mind,5.0,"It's not about good and bad, just about different","I had to add my ideas on Patai's works as I am of both Jewish and Middle Eastern heritage. I can tell you there is a difference between how typical Jewish minds are different from typical Arab minds. The difference is in part ethnocentric. Middle Eastern Jews of American descent, actually emphasize their Middle Eastern heritage above all else. This is not about bad or good but just about differences. We are very happy and proud to be American but adding Syrian American to the mix really seems to build up our ego. That is, only when it comes to the biases of other Syrians. The Jewish mind tends to emphasize dialogue and rigorous debate. Between Arab and Arab, excitation typically permeates the conversation. One is deep the other, lively. No, not better, but yes, different. The primary reason I appreciate Patai's, 'The Jewish Mind', is the very fact that it is so different in terms of length, breadth, detail, and the sheer number of references he uses. Not all Jewish minds are alike as no two minds are alike. Mother and daughter, sister and brother are different as are artists, teachers, musicians and yes, even politicians are unique in the way they think. But, as Patai emphasized, he is referring to types of minds. As doctors must make inferences from the various healthy and sick bodies that they study, so too, can a scholar of the Middle East make inferences we can draw upon. The goal is enlightenment. As long as we can refer to legitimate sources of information, we can do what Kekes calls, 'balanced ' reflection. This type of reflection is not utilitarian but rather imaginative. One can simply review the chapters in this remarkable book in order to sense the scope of Patai's scholarly reach. From the beginning of the heritage we call Judaism, scholars have puzzled over the sheer number of Jewish names in every walk of life. Business, music, art, literature, law, medicine, science and philanthropy are permeated by names of individuals who have referred to themselves as Jewish. Don't just take my word for it. Read the statistics and then ask, 'Can the Jewish and Arab minds really be compared? My answer is 'yes'. Bradd Shore, in his enlightening book, states that culture is intrinsic to meaning formation. Published in 1998, Shore writes, 'Culture must be an intrinsic component of the human mind to a degree that most psychologists and even many anthropologists have not recognized' ( 'Culture in Mind:Cognition, Culture and the problem of Meaning', Shore, Introduction, 1998).","Since the 1960s the relationship between Blacks and Jews has been a contentious one. While others have attempted to explain or repair the break-up of the Jewish alliance on civil rights, Seth Forman here sets out to determine what Jewish thinking on the subject of Black Americans reveals about Jewish identity in the U.S. Why did American Jews get involved in Black causes in the first place? What did they have to gain from it? And what does that tell us about American Jews? In an extremely provocative analysis, Forman argues that the commitment of American Jews to liberalism, and their historic definition of themselves as victims, has caused them to behave in ways that were defined as good for Blacks, but which in essence were contrary to Jewish interests. They have not been able to dissociate their needs--religious, spiritual, communal, political--from those of African Americans, and have therefore acted in ways which have threatened their own cultural vitality. Avoiding the focus on Black victimization and white racism that often infuses work on Blacks and Jews, Forman emphasizes the complexities inherent in one distinct white ethnic group's involvement in America's racial dilemma.",['Seth Forman'],NYU Press,['Religion']

Jane Eyre (New Windmill),5.0,"""I need not sell my soul to buy bliss""","""I need not sell my soul to buy bliss""Jane Eyre is an orphan, raised by her aunt, until one day, she is sent to a horrible school. Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, ""Gone with the Wind""! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, ""Wuthering Heights"", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Looking Backward: 2000-1887 (Signet classics),3.0,"John West, from the late 19th Century, travels to 2000 AD!","On the surface this book published in 1888 is nothing but a small science fiction book about the future, but it doesn't take much digging to find the socialist vision of the future within. While very interesting and, yes, thought provoking, many parts of the book read very much like a political science book than a utopian novel. It is entertaining, yes, but I would not look at it as a study of human society. The book shows the government as 'allowing' things to happen, such as the evolution of small businesses to huge monopolies, while in our own history we know the government of the early 20th century fought it tooth and nail, with anti-trust laws, while the people fought the idea of monopolies, refusing to become nothing more than unfeeling consumers.We are more than just capitalists and workmen.

"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations, (Bohn's standard library)",4.0,"An interesting, but hard read","The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being ""if"". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain. This however doesn't mean that governments should restrict labor/capital mobility, because this would go against the natural liberty of men.",,['Adam Smith'],,['Economics']

The little prince,5.0,Reading this book is time well spent,"I wish I understood French well enough to be able to read it in its original language (without the help of a dictionary) because I suspect that something has been lost in the translation. Even so, this book bears the hallmark of something great: it makes you feel happy, and sad, both at the same time. The story itself is a curiosity and seems almost drug-inspired. However, the message (or rather one of its many messages) is one that needs to be read and understood by adults, not children. The message is: life is absurd, don't take yourself too seriously, and don't be afraid to make friends and love others.

I am certainly not an expert on police procedures, but I doubt if any professional police officer would have acted as she portrayed the police in her novel.

Gulliver's Travels...Illustrated Junior Classics,5.0,"HUMANS: BIG AND LITTLE, UNWISE AND UNCOUTH","GULLIVER'S TRAVELS can be looked at in at least two different ways. On a stand alone basis, it is a satire written by a misanthrope, but if taken within the context of his overall body of work, it can also be perceived as a satire written by a man with a deep concern for mankind.Part I and Part II satirize Englishmen, their religion, politics, and their government. Parts III and IV satirize humanity on a much broader scale.In Part I, we find Lemuel Gulliver shipwrecked on the Island of Lilliput where the average inhabitant is about six inches tall. They are actually small in both body and mind. English religion and politics are satirized by descriptions of those who wear high heels and those who wear low heels, and by the dispute between those who feel their eggs should be broken at the big end and those whose preference is the small end. Like England, through much of history, the Lilliputians are constantly at war with their traditional enemies from across the chanel.In Part II, Gulliver is again stranded, this time on Brobdingnag, where the size proportions are just the opposite as in Part I. Here, Gulliver is tiny in relation to the inhabitants. Here, too, England, and to some extent all of humankind, are taken to task. After Gulliver has described European manners, customs, and behaviour to the king, the king comments that &quot;I cannot but conclude (that) the bulk of your natives (are) the most pernicious race of odious vermin . . . . to crawl on the face of the earth.&quot;Part III takes on the world of scientists, philosophers, historians, and &quot;projectors.&quot; On the flying Island of Laputa, the continent of Lagado, and the Islands of the Sorcerers and Immortals, He meets wise men who spend their lives in speculation but can't handle the practical necessities of life, professors who dedicate their lives to extracting sunlight from cucumbers, and immortals who reveal history to be nothing more than a series of deceptions.Finally, in Part IV, he finds himself in the country of the Houyhnhnms, who are horses with the power to reason. These horses lead clean and simple lives in contrast to the humans, known as Yahoos, who are filthy, brutal, and uncouth. In the Yahoos, Gulliver recognizes the human race, and after finally returning home, he can never again be comfortable in the company of other humans.Read by itself, GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is a satire on the foibles, weaknesses, and petty corruptions of the human race in general, and English politicians in specific, as written by a rather bitter misanthrope. That is a correct reading, but not necessarily the only one. Read in the context of many of Swift's other works, particularly his many political pamphlets, I think that it can be perceived as a satirically inventive work written by a man who really cares about the future of the human race.As an aside, Gulliver's visit to Lilliput has, through the years, enchanted countless numbers of children. It is in this section that we get a peek at Swift's humorous side.",,,,
The art of the Renaissance (Praeger world of art),1.0,Disorganized and uninsightful,"The book does not give an adequate survey of Renaissance Art - in fact, it is not about Renaissance Art at all - most of the book is devoted to pre- and early Renaissance art. Only the last chapter covers the High Renaissance and it is the shortest one in the book. Instead it rambles on and on through some key artists and leaves things at that. They do not describe at all what distinguishes a certain city or period fom another - instead they hone in on one or two paintings, yak about it for a while and leave the reader to infer what they mean. The very worst part is that most of the paintings they babble on and on about are not even plated in the book.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.",['George Orwell'],epubli,['Fiction']

But about 50 years ago I purchased Edward Gorey's illustrated ""War of the Worlds"" and along with the ""Classics Illustrated"" images the images of Gorey's edition burned in to my mind what War of the Worlds should look like.I praise the New York Review of Books for re-publishing this wonderful copy of Wells' novel because if you are going to read Wells' book (and the summer of 2005 is a good time to do it) this is the copy to get and hold and pass down to your kids.I still have my 1950's Edward Gorey copy of ""War of the Worlds"" but just like his Haunted Looking Glass (also re-published by New York Review of Books)my 1950's copies are now so brittle that I do not dare to open them. So now we can have new copies to move us along for 50 more years.Get yourself a Edward Gorey illustrated copy of ""War of the Worlds"" and see that it makes a enjoyable book even more fun.","When a meteorite lands in Surrey, the locals don't know what to make of it. But as Martians emerge and begin killing bystanders, it quickly becomes clear—England is under attack. Armed soldiers converge on the scene to ward off the invaders, but meanwhile, more Martian cylinders land on Earth, bringing reinforcements. As war breaks out across England, the locals must fight for their lives, but life on Earth will never be the same. This is an unabridged version of one of the first fictional accounts of extraterrestrial invasion. H. G.

The House of Mirth,5.0,Lily Bart supporter,"After reading a few of these reviews I got the overwhelming impression that people hadn't tried hard enough to see this book in the context of the time it was written, much as perhaps people today might read Catcher in the Rye and see it as perhaps tame compared to reading it when it was written.Lily Bart was a true victim of the society of her times. Watch or read Age of Innocence and see how society can trap someone and manipulate them without the victim realising until they are beyond their depth and struggling.Ok, so Lily Bart was greedy, much in the same way a lot of people are greedy when they long for something and then suddenly find they have the means to have it. How many of us on payday think Hey I can get that outfit I've been longing for, or that surround sound system even though a part of you is shouting something about the end of the month when your salary will have run out because you did go out and buy something just for that moment of pleasure ? Lily loved that moment of getting something she knew she shouldn't really have, and that double-edge made it even more attractive to have.You have to remember that by the time Lily found that her family had lost it's money she was already of an age where she had spent so long thinking she was going to get it all that she found it hard to relinquish. She turned down early marriage proposals with impetuosity of youth, not wanting to be tied down too early and being too young to realise that there might be a day when it would be too late and that she would regret her rashness. She then finds herself at an age where she is on the edge of being too late to save herself and being on the edge makes her swing from one side to the other: to climb to safe harbour but have no happiness or to feel like she was living a true life and keep swimming in the hope something more worthwhile will come along.Lawrence Selden becomes in a sense her saviour whilst also crucifying Lily unwittingly. Having himself had an affair with a married acquaintance of Lily's she discovers over an illicit meeting with him how she is really viewed and this sets about a chain of events that eventually overtake her. Every time she feels the danger of bending to the will of High Society she recalls Selden's view point and strives to maintain the moral ground she feels she wants him to bear witness to. She falls off the wagon a few times but Selden always seems to come along and she tries again.It is very frustrating seeing how Lily and Selden dance around each other through so many misunderstandings, brought about either by themselves or by other people. Watching Lily's fall you see it coming before she does and are forced to watch helplessly as it happens and keeps happening.Lily is guilty only of wanting the same pleasures others less worthy have without appreciating. She has to have new dresses as part of the charade she is forced to maintain to stay in the game. She buys more than she should because she just can't believe that life won't save her in some way after all her hard work.Lily tries to help others and is constantly trying to live up to the expectations of others whilst also fighting to have some form of life, she just can't decide what it is she would prefer to have and knowing it has such a huge importance she takes too long about deciding.I feel in the end, in the vein of other of Wharton's novels, that the main character chooses the moral ground whilst having to sacrifice happiness, she doesn't choose to sacrifice happiness, that is just a consequence. She is only a short distance away from happiness but never knows it and through no fault of her own deprives herself of it forever. This is a tragic and beautiful book, definitely worth reading although many will feel as I do on the last pages, if only they had been there a day earlier but then this is Wharton's story and she knew where her character's had to go.","A black comedy of manners about vast wealth and a woman who can define herself only through the perceptions of others. The beautiful Lily Bart lives among the nouveaux riches of New York City – people whose millions were made in railroads, shipping, land speculation and banking. In this morally and aesthetically bankrupt world, Lily, age twenty-nine, seeks a husband who can satisfy her cravings for endless admiration and all the trappings of wealth. But her quest comes to a scandalous end when she is accused of being the mistress of a wealthy man. Exiled from her familiar world of artificial conventions, Lily finds life impossible.

More troubling still is the FBI's insistence that the Bureau take over the case, calling the unidentifiedvictim's death a ""hunting accident."" But if a hunter was involved, Chee knows the prey was intentionally human. This belief is shared by the ""Legendary Lieutenant"" Joe Leaphorn, who once again is pulled out of retirement by the possibility of serious wrongs being committed against the Navajo nation by the Washington bureaucracy. Yet it is former policewoman Bernadette Manuelito, recently relocated to Customs Patrol at the U.S. -- Mexico border, who possibly holds the key to a fiendishly twisted conspiracy of greed, lies, and murder -- and whose only hope for survival now rests in the hands of friends too far away for comfort.",['Tony Hillerman'],HarperTorch,['Fiction']
Suzannes Diary For Nicholas,2.0,"A sweet story, but a bit too sappy for me.","If you like stories dripping with tears, you will probably enjoy this story. The story is about a young woman who meets the love of her life, they marry, have a child, and tragedy is always just around the corner. There doesn't seem to be much uplifting about their lives, except perhaps that the memories they make are very nice. This is a fine escape from reality for awhile, and an overall good read, but the story lacks depth, is too predictable, and is gift wrapped at the end, leaving the reader feeling as though it can be put aside and never thought of again. I prefer stories that leave memories with the reader themselves. Still, as Danielle-Steele-ish as it is, you may find that it is poignant in parts, and touches your heart in others.","Changing genres, the author of ""Cradle and All"" offers a moving and suspenseful novel about families, loss, new love, and hope.

Rebel Gold: One Man's Quest to Crack the Code Behind the Secret Treasure of the Confederacy,1.0,"""Rebel Gold"" Hogwash","This paperback is just a reprint of Shadow of the Sentinel with the title changed to Rebel Gold. I guess when sales of a publishing are so poor they call it previously published and put a new title on it, I call that a scam. I'm 63 years old and have lived in Arizona most of my life, raised in Phoenix. I know and have been to every location that Mr. Brewer uses in this book. The only truth I found is when he mentions that except for Adamsville every other location is on Forest Service or BLM controlled land. Which of course is closed to treasure hunting and federal permits to treasure hunt in these areas are rare as hens teeth. So as to anyone proving his wild speculation of the location of this large KGC Cache is not going to happen.The area around Picketpost Mountain has been a fairly active mining area since the Civil War. Within three miles of Picketpost Mtn. to the northeast there was the town of Pinal aka Pinal City from 1878 to 1891, the mill for the Silver King mine was there. The town is gone, but a small cemetery is still there and Mattie Earp is buried in it. Cely Ann ""Mattie"" Blaylock aka Mattie Earp, Wyatt Earp's laudanum addicted girlfriend that he brought with him to Tombstone. The present day town of Superior on U.S. Hwy 60 is only about eight miles northeast of Picketpost Mtn. and goes back to the 1890s as a mining town right up to present day. Picketpost Mtn. is only about two miles south of U.S. Hwy 60. Picketpost Mtn. sticks up out of the desert like a sore thumb and there have been people in the area since the Civil War right up to the present that would have seen any major activity in the area.Some how Mr. Brewer made all his lines and tangents (smoke & mirrors) work on 1900 topographical maps, but they sure don't work on the 1991 topographical maps I used. I guess all these landmarks moved a bit in the those 91 years and won't line up anymore. Rebel Gold aka Shadow of the Sentinel is fantasy from Mr. Brewer's very over active imagination, at least he left out Bigfoot an UFOs. I would not recommend this book under any title to anyone.","As a boy growing up in rural Arkansas, Bob Brewer often heard from his uncle and his great-uncle about a particular tree in the woods, the ""Bible Tree,"" filled with strange carvings. Years later he would learn that this tree was carved with symbols associated with the Knights of the Golden Circle, a Civil War­era secret society that had buried gold coins and other treasure in various remote locations across the South and Southwest in hopes of someday funding a second War Between the States. These secret caches were guarded by sentinels, men whose responsibility it was to watch and protect these sites. To his astonishment, Bob discovered that both his uncle and his great-uncle had been twentieth-century sentinels, and that he had grown up near an important KGC treasure site. In Shadow of the Sentinel, Bob Brewer and investigative journalist Warren Getler tell the fascinating story of the Knights of the Golden Circle and the hidden caches the KGC established across the country. Brewer reveals how, with agonizing effort, he eventually deciphered the fiendishly complicated KGC codes and ciphers, which drew heavily on images associated with Freemasonry. (Many of the key KGC post­Civil War leaders were Scottish Rite Masons, who used the cover of that secret fraternity to conduct their activities.) Using his knowledge of KGC symbolism to crack coded maps, Brewer has located several KGC caches and has recovered gold coins, guns, and other treasure from some of them. Shadow of the Sentinel is the most comprehensive account yet of the activities of the KGC after the Civil War and, indeed, into the 1900s. Getler and Brewer suggest that the clandestine network of KGC operatives was far wider than previously thought, and that it included Jesse James, the former Confederate guerrilla whose stage and bank robberies helped to fill KGC treasure chests. This is a rousing and provocative adventure that weaves together one man's personal quest with an intriguing, little-known chapter in America's hidden history.","['Warren Getler', 'Bob Brewer']",Simon and Schuster,['History']

John S. is one of the greatest talents of all time.","Steinbeck's tough yet charming portrait of people on the margins of society, dependant on one another for both physical and emotional survival Published in 1945, Cannery Row focuses on the acceptance of life as it is: both the exuberance of community and the loneliness of the individual. Drawing on his memories of the real inhabitants of Monterey, California, including longtime friend Ed Ricketts, Steinbeck interweaves the stories of Doc, Dora, Mack and his boys, Lee Chong, and the other characters in this world where only the fittest survive, to create a novel that is at once one of his most humorous and poignant works. In her introduction, Susan Shillinglaw shows how the novel expresses, both in style and theme, much that is essentially Steinbeck: “scientific detachment, empathy toward the lonely and depressed…and, at the darkest level…the terror of isolation and nothingness.” For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

the Picture of Dorian Gray,4.0,The Picture of Dorian Gray,I am pleased with my shipping and the product is how it was described. Fast shipping.,"The Picture of Dorian Gray was first published as a serial in Lippencott’s Monthly Magazine, and the publishers thought it would so offend readers that they removed nearly 500 words without Wilde’s approval. Wilde soon expanded it and republished it as a novel, including a short preface justifying his art. Even though his contemporaries considered it so offensive that some argued for his prosecution, Dorian Gray today survives as a classic philosophical novel that explores themes of aestheticism and double lives.

Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,2.0,Warning for customers,"Any storyteller can tell you that there's little point in telling scary stories without proper atmosphere. Scary stories are told at night around campfires or in darkness lit only by a single flashlight. When reading this book of folktales, you lose the advantage of total darkness and the timing and tone of a storyteller's voice. What made up for the lack were the strange and frightening illustrations of Stephen Gammell. This edition of the book replaces those with far tamer illustrations. Reading it now is akin to telling a scary story while sitting poolside at noon with all your buddies, there's very little impact or involvement for the reader.I hope someday that Harper Collins will bring back the illustrations that truly made these stories scary, but until then I cannot recommend this edition.","Stories of ghosts and witches, ""jump"" stories, scary songs, and modern-day scary stories.",,,"['Ghost stories, American']"

Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,4.0,Dress Your Family in Ridicule and Exposure,"I'm not saying I blame him for doing it, because I don't, but I do feel bad for his poor family. In this book David Sedaris takes them through the ringer and the byproduct is a collection of hilarious, insightful, fascinating stories that I could recommend to anyone. What better source material than our families do any of us have, and he knows this better than anyone as nearly everyone of the stories has them in the starring role. Early on the tone is light as his childhood basks in something of a golden glow, he doesn't get along with his parents, per se, but of course they are right and he is wrong because they are the parent and he is the kid. However, as the book progresses and we dig deeper into his life I was jarred by the dark turns the tales began to take. His disagreements with his parents suddenly have a nasty edge to them. His mom might mean well, but she is judgmental and just a tool of his dad. His dad, on the other hand, is outright aggressive, spitting on everything about him; his homosexuality, his place of residence, his lifestyle choices in general. And while his dad's anti-gay rants make him look bad, Sedaris is also exposing himself to us through them. This is what his dad truly thinks and here is an example of his family not approving of him.My two favorite stories were ""Us and Them"" and ""Six to Eight Black Men."" ""Us and Them"" is the opener and involves his crazy neighbors who, get this, don't have a TV. The wit in the story was making me envious, and the fact that I didn't see my life in the same humorous light was making me feel silly. ""Six to Eight Black Men"" is Sedaris getting back in touch with his roots as he tells a Christmas story with some cultural misunderstandings thrown in for good measure. A lot of the jokes seemed somewhat obvious but I didn't mind, I just went along for the ride. I also liked how he doesn't shy away from racial humor here. Racial jokes have survived the test of time because racial jokes are funny, and for Sedaris to turn his back on a funny joke would be doing a disservice to his readers.As I read through I started to notice how much control he had over each story structure and the prose within. The tone he takes may be conversational, but the way the exposition is laid down perfectly and the foreshadowing boomerangs back around makes you realize that they have all been well thought out. I whipped through the entire book in just a few days which says two things to me: it is kind of fluffy and it is a ton of fun. To Sedaris the world doesn't really reach much further than his domestic situation at any given point so don't look for any real social or political humor. And to me that says that he at least content with his life, sure he lives in Paris for some reason, but good for him. The book is more of the same from Sedaris, but I think you will agree that that is a good thing. My only concern now is what happens when he inevitably runs out of new stories to tell? How many more occurrences from his childhood can there be left that he can take and construct comic gold out of? Oh well, for now enjoy this book which I highly recommend. ***3/4","'No one has a turn of phrase like David Sedaris. This series of essays about his life and family is a joy from start to finish' Adam Kay David Sedaris plays in the snow with his sisters. He goes on vacation with his family. He gets a job selling drinks. He attends his brother's wedding. He mops his sister's floor. He gives directions to a lost traveller. He eats a hamburger. He has his blood sugar tested. It all sounds so normal, doesn't it? In his new book David Sedaris lifts the corner of ordinary life, revealing the absurdity teeming below its surface. His world is alive with obscure desires and hidden motives - a world where forgiveness is automatic and an argument can be the highest form of love.

A Room of One's Own,5.0,"Beautiful, Heartwarming & Inspiring","This is not just an essay on feminism, this is a window to Virginia Woolf's thought pattern and logic. A Room of One's Own is beautifully written, it almost reads like a novel yet is packed with insightful thoughts on the idea of being an independent woman. The roles of women have changed since Virginia wrote this book but that in no way renders this book obsolete, for there are many struggles yet to be overcome and Virginia foresaw that in this book.Her hopes and dreams for women are beautifully expressed and heartwarming. This book is like a gem, the more you look at it the brighter it shines. I have reread A Room of One's Own many times and gotten so much from it. Its a book you will not regret owning.

The count of Monte Cristo (The novels of Alexandre Dumas),5.0,The perfect story,"""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is a literary masterpiece. It has everything one could want in a book and more: adventure, fighting, planning, tales of riches, tales of suffering, tales of ultimate betrayal and revenge, and even a little love.This book may be long, but every single page is worth your time. It is written so perfectly and the story put together with such great design...an epic tale perfect for any reader.","The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel by French author Alexandre Dumas completed in 1844. It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres around a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. In addition, it is a story that involves romance, loyalty, betrayal, and selfishness, shown throughout the story as characters slowly reveal their true inner nature.The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, ""The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.",['Alexandre Dumas'],,

Twenty Things Adopted Kids Wish Their Adoptive Parents Knew,5.0,Great Book for Adoptive Parents and possibly Adoptee's,I have just begun reading this book but can already tell it is going to be very helpful for my husband and I and how we bring up our daughter.

""I want you to take the initiative in opening conversations about my birth family."" ""When I act out my fears in obnoxious ways, please hang in there with me."" ""I am afraid you will abandon me.""

Filled with powerful insights from children, parents, and experts in the field, plus practical strategies and case histories that will ring true for every adoptive family, Twenty Things Adopted Kids Wish Their Adoptive Parents Knew is an invaluable guide to the complex emotions that take up residence within the heart of the adopted child--and within the adoptive home.",['Sherrie Eldridge'],Delta,['Family & Relationships']
Atlas Shrugged,5.0,Changed my life...,"When I was in high school, I was a far-left liberal, believing that people were entitled to anything they wanted. But always in the back of my mind there was something that wasn't quite right with this philosophy, yet I could never pinpoint the incorrect premise in my head. Then a customer of mine gave me this book, and I couldn't put it down once I started reading. It has absolutely changed my life and opened my eyes to the false logic I've been using all my life. I put a lot of time and energy into my work and my projects, and nobody deserves to profit from that but me and me alone. It's not right that millions of people indirectly get my money through collection of taxes and fees which are redistributed through ridiculous programs such as welfare. If everyone in this country started following Rand's philosophy, this country would be in a much better state than it is now. Sadly we're letting it slip away and fall to the level of all the other communist and fascist countries in the world (and the numerous countries which are quickly moving toward those states).This book has made my life goal to make a difference in the world. I hope to stop the motor of the world, just as John Galt did.",,,,
The Republic (Penguin Classics),4.0,Plato's great masterpiece,"This is a fascinating piece of literature because it gives us an intimate look at Socrates who was Plato's mentor. The book is broken up into 10 different sections or books. In this work we get a clear picture of Socrates' idea of an ideal state, and it is remarkable how timely a lot of Socrates' thoughts are to modern day problems, considering that this work was written by Plato in the mid-400's. B.C. A lot of the ideas that are expounded in this massive work are Plato's own. The work is set out in a series of dialogues with two men where Socrates is supposed to be visiting. It begins with a philosophic argument as to what is justice and what is injustice, and from there a whole state is set out. The state includes three main groups of people - The Guardians who rule and advise the rest; the soldiers who defend the state and the workers such as husbandmen or farmers, cobblers, etc. who provide all the useful materials used by the citizens of the state. I found this work pretty tough going as it is long and detailed, but I managed to slog through it all, and actually found the work quite insightful, and certainly interesting.","Plato's Republic is widely acknowledged as the cornerstone of Western philosophy. Presented in the form of a dialogue between Socrates and three different interlocutors, it is an enquiry into the notion of a perfect community and the ideal individual within it. During the conversation other questions are raised: what is goodness; what is reality; what is knowledge? The Republic also addresses the purpose of education and the role of both women and men as 'guardians' of the people. With remarkable lucidity and deft use of allegory, Plato arrives at a depiction of a state bound by harmony and ruled by 'philosopher kings'.",['Plato'],Penguin UK,['Philosophy']

Point Counter Point,5.0,"Brilliant, if slow moving","Though the book takes it's sweet time in making it's points, in the end the payoff is well worth it. You realize that everyone in the book indeed is in one way or another a total jerk, and then the scary thing is when you realize you, and everyone you know, is somehow like any number of the characters. Great debate within over the struggle between passion and reason, hedonism and cold pursuit of &quot;progress&quot; or &quot;The better good&quot;. The book may seem slow, but there is no other way the story, or points could have been effectively made.","Aldous Huxley's lifelong concern with the dichotomy between passion and reason finds its fullest expression both thematically and formally in his masterpiece Point Counter Point. By presenting a vision of life in which diverse aspects of experience are observed simultaneously, Huxley characterizes the symptoms of ""the disease of modern man"" in the manner of a composer - themes and characters are repeated, altered slightly, and played off one another in a tone that is at once critical and sympathetic. First published in 1928, Huxley's satiric view of intellectual life in the '20s is populated with characters based on such celebrities of the time as D.H. Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, Sir Oswald Mosley, Nancy Cunard, and John Middleton Murray, as well as Huxley himself. A major work of the 20th century and a monument of literary modernism, this edition includes an introduction by acclaimed novelist Nicholas Mosley (author of Hopeful Monsters and the son of Sir Oswald Mosley). Along with Brave New World (written a few years later), Point Counter Point is Huxley's most concentrated attack on the scientific attitude and its effect on modern culture.",['Aldous Huxley'],Dalkey Archive Press,['Fiction']
Mozart a Cultural Biography,4.0,excellent bio and history,"This book is a much more pleasing read than Maynard's &quot;Mozart: A Life&quot; - unless you like endless psychological analysis.Gutman describes in detail historical events which influenced the lives of the Mozarts: wars, experiencing freedom in England, interacting with other musicians and philosophers, new outlooks on life and new developments in music.The fine historical detail embellishes the thorough presentation of Mozart's life: for example, knowing his hometown of Salzburg was not part of Austria during his lifetime makes his eventual move to Vienna seem even more dramatic than otherwise.The two reasons I don't give it 5 stars are: 1) it paints a more sanitized picture of Mozart than other sources, and 2) many writers seem to think it enhances their works if they include phrases in foreign languages. Gutman is no exception. For example, Mozart's father's thinking at one point is described as &quot;Aut Ceasar, aut nihil.&quot; This is apparently a somewhat well-known phrase meaning &quot;To Ceasar all or nothing.&quot; but I shouldn't have had to take time out of otherwise enjoyable reading to look it up on the Internet.","An account of the composer's life offers new perspectives and interpretations, placing him within the context of his times, discussing the musical genres he worked in, and giving a clear picture of the man behind the legends",['Robert W.

Poland,5.0,Massively entertaining,"I haven't read much historical fiction up to now, but 'Poland' is definitely the best so far. It's a large work with each chapter typically covering several years at selected points in Polish history between the 13th and 20th centuries. Michener's ability to render convincing scenes (and to a somewhat lesser extent, characters) is astonishing. It's this kind of novel that makes many an aspiring author wave the white flag and give up any pretensions he/she has of being a master storyteller. Nothing wrong with being second class, but you know a master when you read this.Some previous reviews complain about historical inaccuracies in the novel and then pan it with a low rating. Well that is silly because Michener never claimed that 'Poland' is non-fictional. Though the novel is set against a backdrop of actual events in Poland's history and though we encounter many real historical figures (with some or many perhaps portrayed inaccurately), most of the plot and characters are *fictional*. Michener makes this clear right up front in the Explanation section preceding the first chapter. The three families (Lubonski, Bukowski, Buk) that supply the major players throughout the novel are entirely fictional; hence, so are all of their actions. Some of these actions are portrayed in the novel as having pivotal impacts on major historical events (e.g. Wiktor Bukowski's heroic charge in the Battle of Zamosc, 1920). Though these actions and consequences are not historically accurate, Michener never claimed they would be and hence his right to artistic license should be respected.The chapter on the Nazi occupation is particularly well-rendered and chilling. The descriptions of daily life in the Majdanek concentration camp, to my knowledge, do generally stack up with eyewitness accounts from survivors. It's incomprehensible to me that such monstrosities could have been performed on such a scale, so recently.Like most such novels, 'Poland' focuses on major players and key events of political significance (e.g. wars, power struggles, etc). In doing so, I think we miss a bit of how the common people dealt with these events. By common people I mean the peasants, merchants, civilians, nobility et al who did not actually take part in the events (unlike the Lubonskis, Bukowskis, and Buks). In the end, however, 'Poland' is massively entertaining.","The United States and Poland adds a new dimension to the scholarship of America's international relations. Piotr Wandycz presents a comprehensive picture of the changing relationships between the United States and Poland over two hundred years. This work is, as Wandycz writes, both a survey and a synthesis. Because he believes that an understanding of the history of Poland is necessary in order to appreciate the complex nature of its involvement with the United States, he provides a thorough analysis of Poland's internal development, concentrating on the twentieth century. He also carefully places American-Polish history in the broader context of changing East-West relations. Finally, he speculates on the future between the two countries as detente unfolds and surprising happenings like the election of a Polish Pope occur. Ultimately, Wandycz acknowledges, the American-Polish relationship has been one-sided, even more so than is normal in contacts between great and small powers. ""One must not imagine,"" he writes, ""that Poland has been on the minds of American foreign policy makers consistently...but if one thinks of Poland in the context of East Central Europe, her significance increases dramatically.""

The Courage to Be,5.0,Tillich makes the world look shimmeringly alive.,"&quot;It takes tremendous courage to resist the lure of appearances. The power of being which is manifest in such courage is so great that the gods tremble in fear of it.&quot; Paul Tillich, The Courage to Be.Paul Tillich's ideas are a response to existentialism, German philosphy, modern physics &amp; the success of totalitarian movements in Germany, Russia &amp; Italy. He is a bridge between the 19th Century &amp; the growth of new theological thought in latter part of the Twentieth.Tillich is not all that difficult to understand in The Courage to Be. However, it's unfortunate that his three wonderful collections of sermons (The Shaking of the Foundations; The New Being; The Eternal Now) are out-of-print, as these are his best introductions.Readers coming to Tillich will have to grapple with the common metaphors of Christian faith. For Tillich, the concepts of Heaven &amp; even an afterlife are not terribly important, as they imply a continuation of life in time that he is not able to accept scientifically or on faith. So one meets those lovely semi-metaphors of &quot;being itself,&quot; &quot;non-being&quot; &amp; &quot;ground of being&quot; that, for me at least, were a more clear explanation of how I experience the world than God the &quot;Father&quot; or Holy Ghost.This makes Tillich a crucial step into Feminist &amp; Language theology, although he couldn't quite make the big leap himself.Basically, Tillich says we're stuck in an undefinable present that moves creatively into an unknown future in which nothing is a given but the fact that we are alive right now, so what do we intend to do about it? This is &quot;being&quot; &amp; being, above all else, requires courage; the courage of early Christians facing the axe or the fire. As for Tillich's &quot;Ground of Being,&quot; one might compare it - inadequately - to a tree as a reflection of its roots - a metaphor I copped from another Paul ...artist Paul Klee. Tillich says that we cannot speak unsymbolically about being.In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, Paul Tillich's theology gains even greater relevance. He witnessed in Germany the acquiescence of the established churches to National Socialism &amp; the failure of Democratic Christian Socialism. I do not believe he would have many kind words for contemporary Islam, a religious system so bound to orthodoxy as to make it incapable of relevant reform. On the other hand, Tillich would have immediately recognized those manifestations of the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; which began appearing even before the Twin Towers had collapsed. Our estrangement from God in the Eternal Now (which invites demonic energy as a tall tree invites lightning) is overcome only in the present moment. Evil may be defeated with violent retaliation, but it is conquered with love.Paul Tillich is especially liberating for artists. Stopping just short of Buddhism, Tillich makes the world look shimmeringly alive &amp; filled with possibilities, yet so transient - a world of appearances.&quot;The courage to be is rooted in the God who appears when God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt.&quot; Paul Tillich, The Courage to BeBob RixonAlso recommended&quot; Henri Bergson, An Introduction to Metaphysics","“Marie Kondo, but for your brain.” —HelloGiggles “Compelling from front to back.

A Deepness in the Sky,5.0,Great science fiction,"This is great science fiction! I usually like Vinge's books, and this one was fully up to par. It intertwines two converging stories. One is about a group of (human) freedom loving space traders who travel and sell in many star systems, who are thrown together with (human) totalitarian exploiters. The other is about an intelligent race of spiders whose &quot;on-off&quot; star blinks with a century-long period -- thus they must endure a multi-decade deep freeze during their lifetimes (the &quot;Deepness&quot; in the title is a place where spiders can hibernate through a freeze).This is great science fiction. The plot is exciting, and Vinge invents and explores the ramifications of several interesting technologies plus the weird on-off star environment. He also explores social conflicts between the human societies and the spider societies. Both sets of societies appear to have intentional parallels with current societies here on earth.I believe Vinge intends those parallels to be an important part of the book, so I'm going to write a little more about them. Many of Vinge's books feature societies based around a libertarian ideal of little or no government, and privatization of government's traditional functions. For example, in a story called &quot;The Ungoverned,&quot; a section of the former United States has no government at all, and people hire private companies with names like &quot;Michigan State Police&quot; and &quot;Al's protection Racket&quot; for traditional government services.One problem with a government-free society is the possibility that some people may completely trample the rights of others without fear of reprisal. In &quot;Deepness,&quot; Vinge encapsulates that problem as the problem slavery. The totalitarians are not averse to slavery; the freedom-loving traders despise slavery.I see one flaw in the book, which doesn't affect the science fiction or the exciting plot; only the philosophy. The flaw is that Vinge doesn't adequately account for *why* the good guys' hate slavery. After all, one could consider slavery a form of contract, or slaves an article of trade (slavery was treated this way here on earth for thousands of years). Vinge's explanation of why the traders hate slavery is essentially social taboo -- it's part of the trader culture. But it's a taboo that has lasted a thousand years and holds everywhere in the many loose-knit trader communities. Why? We know societies change and upstarts challenge taboos, so the ones that remain must serve some very useful purpose. Vinge doesn't account for the constancy of the taboo.I think a libertarian philosophy that allowed slavery would be repugnant to many readers, so Vinge created one that prevented slavery, but his taboo mechanism is weak. I think this points up a flaw in libertarian philosophy that Vinge is struggling to deal with -- the flaw being that libertarianism may be a little to value-neutral to appeal to mainstream American readers raised on apple pie and the U.S. Constitution. I'll be interested to see how Vinge continues to deal with this issue in future writings.Never the less, as I mentioned above, the flaw doesn't affect the plot or the science fiction; only the philosophy of the book. It's still great SF, imaginative and thought provoking, and a very enjoyable read.","A Hugo award-winning Novel! “Vinge is one of the best visionary writers of SF today.” —David Brin Thirty-Thousand years before A Fire Upon the Deep, humans stand on the verge of first contact with an alien race.

"The Subtle Knife: His Dark Materials, Book 2",5.0,Beautiful!,"Like many folks, I find that the second installment in a trilogy is often the weakest. The author usually runs out of steam, or doesn't care about his/her characters enough to put them into as interesting a set of situations as they were in with volume #1. Perhaps, the author feels that he/she can take a breather and bring everything up to speed with #3.Not so with Pullman. He delivers a wallop with the first page and doesn't let up. Pullman also ends the book with a set of cliffhangers that must have made readers absolutely nuts until &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; arrived.The tenderness is still there (I nearly cried over the parts about Will's mother).

Lyra is as tough and smart as always, while still making mistakes and paying for them. Pullman is also brave enough to kill off a few of his favorites, which keeps up the plausibilty level and propels the survivors forward.And the concept of a righteous war in Heaven...! The author shows a tremendous amount of courage even to bring up the subject, let alone tackle it to the degree he does.

The Big Book of Brewing,5.0,Should be part of any brewing library!,"I read a rewiew on David Line's book, ""Brewing Beers Like Those You Buy"". I felt the rewiew was so wrong that I wrote the following:Dave Line wrote two great books, ""The Big Book of Brewing"" and this book. This book was a recipe book, not a guide. It's great to see how he approached brewing each beer. I have been brewing full mash brewing since 1980. I usually brew bitter and pale ales. This book is a constant reference.Other than the discontinued use of Sodium metabisulphite for sterilization, I'm not sure how ""Homebrewing has evolved so much since then""?His Big Book of Brewing was written in 1974 and the recipe book in 1978. The making great beer has not changed since then. The full mash process has been the same for hundreds of years.Both books are great reference books and should be part of any brewing library.","This is a book for any really enthusiastic and ambitious home brewer - the person who wants to brew high quality, 'true' beers using real hops and grains, rather than by using more easily-handled kits and powdered or liquid malt extracts.",['Dave Line'],,['Brewing']

"Incubus Dreams (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 12)",5.0,What's the fuss folks?,"I've read many of these reviews and almost did not purchase Ms. Hamilton's next book in the Anita Blake series (Incubus Dreams) because of them. I am glad I purchased it despite the mixed reviews. I don't understand why so many people are whining about the sex. I found the scenes to be surprising and entertaining. Yes, there were more graphic sex scenes than in previous stories - but, hey - I thought it was a logical direction for the story to go. Anita has been evolving into the person that she ultimately becomes in this novel. I do not think that I could have taken any more of her tip-toeing around serious issues in her relationships (yes, relationships - as in more than one) or anymore of her self-loathing because of her sexual desires. People, just realize a few things: One, this is a book - it is entertainment; Two - vampires, werewolves, necromancers, etc. are not real (see point number one); Three - if you are this far into the series and are surprised and shocked by this turn of events you probably should not read vampire books.","In her role as consort of Jean-Claude, the seductive Master Vampire of the City, Anita Blake is faced with a dangerous conflict of interest when she assists with the search for a vampire serial killer who is stalking strippers.",['Laurell K.

Psycho-Cybernetics,5.0,The First Book of It's Kind I Read,"This is the first book of it's kind I ever read and it is still a truly inspiring and very informative work today.Best wishes,Donald Ryles PhD, CHAuthor of Hidden Secrets of ""Many, But One","Cybernetics (loosely translated from the Greek): “a helmsman who steers his ship to port.” Psycho-Cybernetics is a term coined by Dr. Maxwell Maltz, which means, “steering your mind to a productive, useful goal so you can reach the greatest port in the world, peace of mind.” Since its first publication in 1960, Maltz’s landmark bestseller has inspired and enhanced the lives of more than 30 million readers. In this updated edition, with a new introduction and editorial commentary by Matt Furey, president of the Psycho-Cybernetics Foundation, the original text has been annotated and amplified to make Maltz’s message even more relevant for the contemporary reader. “Before the mind can work efficiently, we must develop our perception of the outcomes we expect to reach. Maxwell Maltz calls this Psycho-Cybernetics; when the mind has a defined target it can focus and direct and refocus and redirect until it reaches its intended goal.” —Tony Robbins (from Unlimited Power) Maltz was the first researcher and author to explain how the self-image (a term he popularized) has complete control over an individual’s ability to achieve (or fail to achieve) any goal. And he developed techniques for improving and managing self-image—visualization, mental rehearsal, relaxation—which have informed and inspired countless motivational gurus, sports psychologists, and self-help practitioners for more than fifty years. The teachings of Psycho-Cybernetics are timeless because they are based on solid science and provide a prescription for thinking and acting that lead to quantifiable results.",['Maxwell Maltz'],Penguin,['Self-Help']

The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories (Penguin Classics),5.0,A Novel of Compassion,"The Country of Pointed Firs is comprised of a series of stories, unified in the setting and interaction among the the characters. The values of the characters are revealed clearly. They are people of an earlier time in New England, specifically Maine, living on islands, small towns, and farms. The book contains vivid description of the ocean, the country side, gardens, and the fir trees. The style is simple, direct, and Jewett uses local idiom, bringing a charm to the book. A series of stories, each complete in themselves, is similar to the style of Willa Cather in her novels and Sherwood Anderson in Winesburg Ohio. There is no complex plot, but rather a development of character, revealing profound emotion and people touched by a complexity of events. It is not accurate to see the novel as sentimental episodes or an idealizing, or romantizing of small towns and agrarian life. Her legitmate place in American Literature is becoming more and more secure.

The Picture of Dorian Gray,2.0,I just didn't like it...,"Ugh, what to say about this book. I wanted so badly to love it, but I didn't. I didn't even like it a little bit. That's terrible when you don't really enjoy the very first classic you read. This isn't setting a good stage for the future and planning on reading one classic a month. Good thing Alice in Wonderland is next month. That will definitely make up for the suck of this one. Don't you hate it when you hear such good things about a book and you go in expecting to love it only to be completely disappointed? Yeah, that's what happened here.The book follows Dorian Gray (the original Mr. Gray, if you will) who is apparently a very beautiful man who is envied by many only he doesn't quite understand why. I liked Dorian but I didn't feel like his character had much depth. I liked that he wasn't all look how sexy I am you know you want this, but at the same time he was kind of a sissy. He follows this Lord Henry guy around like he's a lost little puppy dog and puts up with him bashing him on numerous occasions. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but I had to force myself not to skip over his parts. The only rational person in this book (minus his psycho obsession over Dorian) is Basil but he isn't in enough of the book to really care too much about.I think I know why I couldn't get into this book as much as the rest of the people who told me about it. Have you seen the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Okay, I see Dorian Gray in that movie when I think about him. I see Stuart Townsend in all his ""I'm the bomb get over it"" glory. I cannot and will not picture him as the pushover that he was in this book. That movie ruined the book for me. I remember watching the actual Dorian Gray movie but it was boring too. I may have to watch it again just to see how terrible it was in comparison to the book, but I vaguely remember falling asleep at some point.The only reason I didn't give it one butterfly is because I was able to finish it. It was hard and it seemed like forever, but I did it. And the only reason I did it was to get to the end. I read on and off for like five days just to read about the scene I could have watched in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen after only an hour and a half. Stuart Townsend will always be my Dorian Gray. This book just didn't do it for me. However... Dorian is a VERY cool name.

"Atlantis, The Lost Continent Finally Found",5.0,A quick FYI about the links and website,"Although this is not a review per se, it is worth mentioning that Dr. Santos passed away early in 2005 and the sales and upkeep of the book data as well as the upkeep and availability of the site was discontinued. The site is back up and sales have commenced now, but for those who were attributing the lack of support and/or validity of the bonus information sources to negligence, poor writing or indifferent support, there must be far less acceptable explanations for such a lapse than the passing of the author behind the work.","The late author Arysio Santos was a highly regarded climatologist, geologist, and nuclear physicist. He was also a scholar of history, folklore, languages, and the occult. In this groundbreaking study of Atlantis, he draws on all these disciplines, as well as ancient maps, Plato’s dialogues, and folkloric narratives, to provide the most compelling case yet of the disappearance of an entire civilization. Professor Santos demonstrates that Plato’s dating of Atlantis’s disappearance in 11,600 BP (before present) precisely corresponds to the catastrophic end of the Pleistocene Ice Age, as well as a historic flood event of cataclysmic proportions. The rising of the sea level by nearly 500 feet, he argues, submerged continent-sized lands—including Atlantis, which he connects with the biblical Garden of Eden. Provocative chapters cover such topics as the continent’s appearance in ancient maps, Indonesia as the true site of Eden, American interpretations of Atlantis, the four rivers of paradise, and more, giving a clear form to the ghostly outline of this fabled land.",['Arysio Santos'],North Atlantic Books,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']"

Outsiders,4.0,A Thrilling Realistic Story,"S.E. Hinton's novel of class conflict, choice and determination, set in 1950s Oklahoma, creates empathy for characters that live on the periphery of society. Hinton's protagonist, Pony boy, along with his fellow ""gang"" members, including Two-bit, Dally, Darry and Johnny, are ""greasers"". Outwardly, they are an unsavory lot. They wear their hair long and greasy, wear jeans, t-shirts and, if they can eat chocolate cake and soda for breakfast, live in unfashionable homes in poor neighborhoods and are generally doomed to poor-paying blue-colored jobs. They do little to endure themselves to those who are not of their group. For instance, at the drive-in movie, they ""introduce"" themselves to some girls through uncouth behavior.The average greaser's nemesis is the ""soc"". The soc comes from a privileges background, wears fashionable clothing and often enjoys his or her parents' indulgence.Hinton, through a series of plot elements, presents the greasers as the misunderstood heroes of the book. For instance, Johnny, the least aggressive of the greasers, kills a soc. However, the killing is clearly presents as a case of self-defense. Further, we understand that Johnny had previously been savagely beaten by the very same soc who, on this occasion, without question, had intended to kill Johnny. Johnny later suffers fatal wounds when he rescues a group of children from a burning church- the same building in which he and Pony boy had been hiding out subsequent to the killing of Bob.The toughest greaser also is portrayed sympathetically. Even when Dally ends up being shot by the police after he attempted armed robbery, Dally seems more a tragic than a threatening figure. Pony boy reveals that Dally's gun did not hold and bullets; Dally desperate act is attributed to his inability to cope with Johnny's death.Throughout the book, the greasers are portrayed as loyal and misunderstood, imbued with an anger and despair that has been etched upon their psyches through years of abuse and neglect.Despite this, Johnny and Pony boy are able to maintain a grasp upon their humanity. Johnny pays with his life. Pony boy's fate is more promising. His nervous collapse at the end of the novel galvanizes the resolve of the rest of the greasers. They vow to break the cycle wherein their fate seems pre-determined if not for their own sake, then for Pony boy's. ""Don't get tough,"" Two-Bit urges Pony, ""You're not like the rest of us and don't try to be (Hinton 1989, p. 152).&qout; Soda reminds him, ""I you don't have anything, you end up like Dallas... and I don't mean dead, eather (Hinton 1989, p. 152).""Where Hinton's vision lacks courage is in her portrayal of the greasers as societal victims who lack genuine flaws. Certainly the greasers keep irregular hours, watch too much television, smoke and have poor diets, but they do not have serious faults. Any faults can be readily attributes to their circumstances and to the inequitable political and social systems that subjugate them. Hinton's novel would have been more of an achievement had she been able to generate empathy for the members of an underclass who are not simply ""noble savages"". It is easy to accept the romantic portrayal of a marginalized class of people; it is difficult to accept a cold, accurate rendering of the same group, especially when the group's attitudes, values and behaviors are profoundly different from those of the reader.Still, Hinton's work, while it is often sentimental, is also also sensitive and even poetic. We can hear Hinton herself speaking through Pony boy when he laments, ""I could picture hundreds and hundreds of boys living on the wrong sides of cities, boys with blink eyes who jump at their own shadows. Hundreds of boys who maybe watch sunsets and looked at stars and ached for something better (Hinton 1989, P. 155).",The struggle of three brothers to stay together after their parent's death and their quest for identity among the conflicting values of their adolescent society.,['S.

In a recent contest, Bob has proved himself a matchless sheepdog, and if he wins the trophy two more times, he’ll be seen as equal to the legendary sheepdogs of yore. But Bob has a real rival: Red Wull, with his docked tail and bristling yellow fur, a ferocious creature, just like his diminutive master, Adam McAdam, a lonely Scot, estranged not only from his English neighbors but from his son, David. McAdam just can’t stop belittling this strapping young man, all the more so since David began courting Moore’s beautiful daughter Maggie. But what McAdam really wants is for his beloved Wullie to wrest the prize from Bob once and for all. The story takes a darker turn when a troubling new threat to the local flocks emerges. A dog has gone rogue, sneaking out at night to feast on the flesh and blood of the sheep he is bound to protect. Again and again, new sheep fall prey to this relentless predator; again and again, he slips away undetected. This master hunter can only be among the boldest and sharpest of dogs . . .

At the time the author encountered them, the &quot;people of the twilight&quot; were living much as they had for hundreds of years before the &quot;white invasion.&quot;The book is remarkable for the absolute objectivity of the author, the unpretentious writing, and, given the time it was written - amazingly lacking any tone of cultural superiority. (For example, an account of infanticide by Eskimos is a particular frank, thoughtful, although disturbing discussion). The life he describes is a neverending search for food and shelter, one that in many ways, echoes from times primeval.Jennes sensed that he was viewing a culture about to undergo massive change. He recounts in a epilogue written in the 1950's, what the future brought was near annihilation of many Eskimo peoples through disease, and catastrophic cultural pressures. Despite his premonition, like the Eskimos who kept him alive, Jennes is able to focuses on the present clearly and without nostalgia.A book worth reading to understand a people who were indeed in the twilight.","Description of the author's experiences among the Eskimos of the Coronation Gulf region, Canada.",['Diamond Jenness'],New York : Macmillan,['Canada']
When Darkness Falls (Jack Swyteck),5.0,When darkness falls,I found the book to very interesting. I was unable to put it down after reading the first chapter. This the second book of James Grippando that I have read but I will be reading more in the future.,"In the latest novel from the bestselling author whom critics have called ""the thriller writer to watch,"" lawyer Jack Swyteck tackles a case in which the life of his best friend hangs in the balance—and in which nothing is as it seems. Miami criminal defense attorney Jack Swyteck isn't looking for a new client, at least not one who is homeless and in jail for threatening to jump off a bridge. But from the moment Jack is called to defend the man, who goes by the name Falcon, something is amiss. For one thing, Falcon comes up with the $10,000 bail—in cash. Then the body of a brutally murdered woman is found in the trunk of the abandoned car in which he is living. Panicked and on the run, Falcon takes Jack's best friend, Theo, hostage. They end up barricaded in a motel room, and Theo isn't the only one at Falcon's mercy. Jack must work with the cops and their crackerjack negotiator to free Theo and the other captives before Falcon decides he has nothing to lose by killing them all. What Jack doesn't know is that Falcon has a much bigger agenda, and that there are people behind the scenes who will stop at nothing to keep their dangerous secrets. Thus unfolds a riveting, lightning-paced story, as only James Grippando can tell it.",['James Grippando'],Harper Collins,['Fiction']
The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil),4.0,"Informative, but somewhat repetitive","After listening to a podcast featuring the author, I purchased this book eager to learn more. It did not disappoint with the plethora of interesting facts and information, but some of the book was hard to get through in that it seemed repetitive.

Flush,4.0,Flush is good fun,"Maybe not quite as festive as Hiaasen's ""Hoot,"" but still a darn good read.

Why I'm Against It All: Rants and Reflections,5.0,Why small publishers are essential,"Self-described Colorado ""wild man"" Ken Wright's second book, ""Why I'm Against It All,"" is a glowing example of why small publishers are increasingly essential in these hard-sell times of corporate media conglomerations interested only in fast profit. ""Why"" is a rare gem of a book that's far more informed, insightful, entertaining and important than most of what comes out of the New York ""big house"" profit mills these sickly days. As a long-time Rocky Mountain, small-town, edge dweller--ski bum, river guide, desert rat, bus driver, construction worker, teacher, newspaper columnist, environmental and social activist and more--Wright has his thumb on the political, cultural and spiritual life of small Rocky Mountain tourist towns like no other writer I know. While heavily influenced by Edward Abbey, Wright's ""rants"" are his own, in no way an imitation of anyone else. And best of all, like Abbey, Ken Wright has the sense of humor essential to make his ranting not only bearable, but brilliant. If New York had any true book sense or any social and literary conscience--and if American readers had a bit more intelligence and open-minded curiosity--the big houses would be competing to sign writers like Wright and books like ""Why I'm Against it All."" But they don't, and they won't. Nor will you likely see such small-publisher titles by ""regional"" writers prominently displayed in the big chain bookstores, if they carry them at all. That's why local independent booksellers and Amazon.com are absolutely essential to the future of free speech, creativity, new talent and truth in America today. We must support them all.","Humorous, sometimes biting commentary on the state of the American West. Wright adroitly explores the meaning and value of wilderness, outdoor adventuring, small town life and how it is changing, and raising kids in the early 21st century west.",['Ken Wright'],Raven's Eye Press,['Nature']
Eleni,5.0,Definitely a must read!!,"I loved this book. I checked it out from the library a few years ago after seeing the movie, but didn't really dig in and read it. Several years later and with a son of my own, I read the book. In fact I stayed up almost all night to keep reading it. I can't think of a book I have loved more. Gage does a great job keeping the reader straight on the myriad of characters in the book and above all, does a wonderful job describing his family's experiences. I truly wept while reading this book. Just buy it!!","A son's quest to avenge his mother's murder. In 1948, in a Greek mountain village, Eleni Gatzoyiannis was arrested, tortured and shot. She was one of the 158,000 victims of the Greek Civil War. Her crime had been to help her children escape from the Communist guerrillas who occupied their village. Her son, Nicholas Gage, was then eight years old. Eleni is the story of his obsessive and harrowing reconstruction of his mother's life and death and his pursuit of his mother's killer.",['Nicholas Gage'],Random House,['Biography & Autobiography']
The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (Thorndike Nonfiction),1.0,This book fouses on moral tirvialities.,"This book in a highly obvious way contributes to the death of outrage itself, since it focuses moral judgment on whatmost people understand to be moral trivialities. Moral judgment is an important concept and one which should be used more and not less in politics. The problem with right wing and conservative morality, such as Mr. Bennett's, is that it ignores vast areas of blatant wrongdoing on a global or international scale and tries to make focus on sex scandal a substitute for that. For example, President Clinton could be rightly judged for his recent bombing of the defenseless citizens of Iraq and for his continuation of the economic sanctions that have killed 1.6 million Iraqis, half of them children under the age of five. That, of course, is a more difficult item, since many politicians are also complicit in the same actions.Morality is of vital importance in public affairs, but the type of morality that focuses on the most minute and ignores the most egregious offenses is at the very least sickening and at the worst apt to dull the sensitivities of the public. Another example of upside down morality is the so-called &quot;right to life&quot; movement that is so conspicuously absent from anti-war and anti-capital punishment movements. So, morality gets focused on saving embryo's with the developmental level of a tadpole (but the appearance of a human being) while warfare, the organized slaughter of millions of fully-developed human beings, is all fine and dandy.No, &quot;The Death of Outrage&quot; does not provide any useful guidance to morality in public life but, instead, contributes a substitute pseudomorality that itself degrades morality.",,,,['Books']
Adobe Indesign CS One-On-One,2.0,Left me wanting more,"Let me start by saying that InDesign One-on-One is the best book I've ever purchased on Amazon.com. There is so much knowledge, so much learning. I've never learned so much from one book. If you want to learn InDesign I wholeheartedly recommend it. You really get to experience exerptise when going through this book.That said, there are of course a few issues I have with the book. I couldn't get a few steps to work and there are a few typos or errors in dialog boxes or textual errors in the book.But my biggest gripe is that there are no complete projects. That is, you always start in the middle of a project and just exercise a few techniques. So you never make a newsletter or book, etc. I wish that one of these books I buy would have me take a project from beginning to end. Mr. McClelland's mastery of InDesign overwhelmed me, but at the end I felt like I was wanting more. I don't really know how to design a book or an essay or a newsletter. Even though I've seen a lot of what InDesign does, I've mastered none of it.",,,,
100 Simple Secrets of Great Relationships : What Scientists Have Learned and How You Can Use It,5.0,Wow! I wish this was required pre-marital reading!,"I have read all of Dr. Niven's books and have found EVERY one of them to be FANTASTIC! People, Relationships, Best Half of Life, Happy People, etc have all been wonderful ideas with the research the idea is based on. As a psychologist, I hate suggesting books (bibliotherapy) that is half-baked or some crap off Opera. David Niven's is concrete, shouldn't offend anyone with a 'religious' overtone (get over it anyways), and not likely to lead them off to some cult or guru. Just plain, safe, reliable and healthy perspectives. Truly ""what scientists have learned and how you can use it.""","What are the essential qualities of a great relationship? What do people in healthy and happy relationships do differently? Scientists and academics have spent entire careers investigating the nature of relationships, dating, and marriage, yet their findings are inaccessible to ordinary people, hidden in obscure journals read only by other academics. Now the bestselling author of the 100 Simple Secrets series has collected the most current and significant data from more than a thousand studies on relationships and spells out the key findings in plain English. The advice is not based on one person's unique experiences or opinions, but offers for the first time the research of noted scientists studying the lives and loves of average Americans. Each of the findings is accompanied by a true story that shows the results in action. Love is hard to calculate: Researchers have proven that a partner's age, income, education, and religion are unrelated factors in the likelihood of relationship satisfaction. Always trying to win can lead to a major loss: People who feel a sense of competition with their partner are 37 percent less likely to feel that their relationship is satisfying. leave the past in the past: More than 40 percent of people report that jealousy over a previous relationship is a source of conflict in their current relationship.","['David Niven, PhD']",Harper Collins,['Family & Relationships']
Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK,4.0,A well written book but still does not convince me,Posner writes a great book on the lone guneman theory but he chooses to ridicule every supporter of multiple gunmen and his chapter on Jim Garrison reeks of bias - but that aside it makes great reading anyway and I think Posner sets about his task intelligently and thoroughly - Buy It!!!,"Pulitzer Prize Finalist: “By far the most lucid and compelling account . . . of what probably did happen in Dallas—and what almost certainly did not.” —The New York Times Book Review The Kennedy assassination has reverberated for five decades, with tales of secret plots, multiple killers, and government cabals often overshadowing the event itself. As Gerald Posner writes, “Fifty years after the assassination, the biggest casualty has been the truth.” In this first-ever digital edition of his classic work, updated with a special comment for the fiftieth anniversary, Posner lays to rest all of the convoluted conspiracy theories—concerning the mafia, a second shooter, and the CIA—that have obscured over the decades what really happened in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963. Drawing from official sources and dozens of interviews, and filled with powerful historical detail, Case Closed is a vivid and straightforward account that stands as one of the most authoritative books on the assassination of John F. Kennedy.",['Gerald Posner'],Open Road Media,['History']

Georges Braque A Life,5.0,life of this leading modernist painter mostly in relation to friends and other artists of his time,"With the back matter of three short appendices, lengthy notes, lengthy bibliography, and index starting on page 280, this makes the text less than 300 pages. Danchev's biography on this early modernist artist relates his influence on contemporary artists and on modern art as well as influences on him mostly through Braque's relationships with others. The treatment is not a probing psychological study, nor an aesthetic critique and evaluation; but rather concentrates on aspects of Braque's everyday life--his friendships, his trips, his habits. Braque's long and fertile relationship with Picasso was central to Braque's creativity. Danchev also spends time on Braque's marriage to Marcelle Vorvanne, giving her a mini-biography of her own. Another important relationship for Braque was with Jean Paulhan, one of the editors of ""Nouvelle Revue Francaise,"" who ""became [the artist's] greatest tribune and celebrant."" Paulhan wrote about Braque's painting, ""[I]t is without doubt that his work is at all times strangely complete and sufficient...[with the ultimate] feeling of a delay enjoyed, and an obligation fulfilled."" Such observations from others in Braque's life are not only illuminating and stimulating in themselves, but accrue to cast light on the complexities and enigma of Braque--as with any historically significant artist--and his paintings; several of which are shown in color plates. Danchev has written other biographies and is a professor in the School of Politics at the U. of Nottingham.","Together with Picasso and Matisse, Georges Braque is unquestionably one of the three great pillars of twentieth-century art. Here is the first full-length biography of this remarkable figure. A pioneer of modern art and founder of Cubism, Georges Braque was a creative genius and tireless innovator, constantly pushing back the boundaries of the possible. In this magisterial work, Alex Danchev taps a wide range of new sources to reveal the heart and mind of one who helped usher in the greatest revolution in the ways of seeing since the Renaissance and changed the face of modern art.",['Alex Danchev'],Simon and Schuster,['Biography & Autobiography']

Blood Work,5.0,"A different, excellent thriller","This is my first Michael Connelly book. His flowing, easy writing style grabbed me from page one, and along the book the cool plot and the above-average developed, human and likable characters did the rest of the job for me. His other books will be part of my reading list, no doubt.The main character is Terry McCalleb, a retired FBI agent, now living in a boat anchored at a marina in LA. He's retired because his heart played a trick on him, and he had to wait two years at the organ-receiving line, almost loosing his life in the process. Finally, two months after a successful transplant, all he wants to do is fix his boat and drive to Catalina. But then, suddenly, a beautiful woman comes along and asks him to investigate the violent murder of her sister. McCalleb says he's off the game and won't do it, but then Graciela (that's the woman's name) says he should think about it, since the heart now in McCalleb's chest once belonged to her deceased sister.From then on, the book goes from a seemingly simple situation to a very complex plot. It's interesting to see how Connelly makes McCalleb work, sometimes even to complete loose ends, just to a little bit later discover something he had previously missed. McCalleb is a coherent character, and the reader can't help but like him. Other characters are intersting as well, good ones and bad ones.After reaching the end, I noticed that the solution is in plain sight in the middle of the book, if the reader pays enough attention or is interested in spoiling the fun for the end. I suggest not an investigative reading, but an enjoyable one. Just go along with McCalleb and it will be fine. Not the usual serial-killer-forensic-investigation thriller. Way above average.Grade 9.1/10",,,,

Kathryn Petersen, Decision Tech's CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: Uniting a team in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight.

Attila Jzsef Selected Poems,3.0,"Attila Jozsef's ""Selected poems""","Attila Jozsef's Selected Poems is truly an emotional set of poems. No person who loves poetry should be without this book in their collection. Each page is filled with diction that makes one want to read more and more. His style of poetry is very explicit and graphic. The language is bold and very human-like. These poems show the dark side of human nature and how lonely it can be. We see Attila Jozsef explain his life through these poems and how he was always afraid to lose the things that were closest to him. The book is split up into five parts, and each part is filled with several or more poems. After reading the poems, Attila Jozsef seems to have an emotional connection to his mother who had put him in an orphanage and died before he even got to see her again. He blames his mother for his loneliness in the poems. He also expresses he wants to join his mother in her grave. The poems also give clues of his apparent suicidal nature, and how he believed in nihilism. (Believing in nothing) Jozsef also attacks God for giving such a lonely and depressing life. Throughout Jozsef's poems, one sees that he constantly looked for ways to escape reality. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something truly out of the ordinary. Attila Jozef is not afraid to go beyond the limits of normal poetry. He dives right into the darkness of human behavior and his poems are really one of a kind.","Award-winning translator Peter Hargitai celebrates 100 years of Attila József (1905-1937) in this new selection of 100 poems.
