The Case for Easter: Journalist Investigates the Evidence for the Resurrection,4.0,Good book for a quick read,This is a good book that's a quick read. The chapters that appear in this book are also in The Case for Christ. I did enjoy both books and found them to be quite interesting. Not only is the theological evidence strong it is supported by archeological and medical evidence. I think this is a good book for any one who is interested in Christ and doesn't know where to start.,"Did Jesus of Nazareth really rise from the dead? Of the many world religions, only one claims that its founder returned from the grave. The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the very cornerstone of Christianity. But a dead man coming back to life? In our sophisticated age, when myth has given way to science, who can take such a claim seriously? Some argue that Jesus never died on the cross. Conflicting accounts make the empty tomb seem suspect. How credible is the evidence for--and against--the resurrection? Focusing his award-winning skills as a legal journalist on history's most compelling enigma, Lee Strobel retraces the startling findings that led him from atheism to belief. He examines: The Medical Evidence: Was Jesus' death a sham and his resurrection a hoax? The Evidence of the Missing Body: Was Jesus' body really absent from his tomb? The Evidence of Appearances: Was Jesus seen alive after his death on the cross? Written in a hard-hitting journalistic style, The Case for Easter probes the core issues of the resurrection. Jesus Christ, risen from the dead: superstitious myth or life-changing reality? The evidence is in. The verdict is up to you.",['Lee Strobel'],Zondervan,['Religion']
The Case for Faith: A Journalist Investigates the Toughest Objections to Christianity,5.0,A Compelling Case,"In his original work ""The Case for Christ"", Lee Strobel set out on a mission to erase his doubts about any and all aspects of Christianity. That process continues in this follow-up work.Right off the bat, the only negative things I can say about this book is that the title is a bit misleading. Only one chapter deals with what I would consider to truly be ""faith issues"". The other material is more like ""Case for Christ II"".That being said, this book is excellent in every other aspect. Strobel conducts himself in such an unbiased fashion that his conclusions are legitimized by hard work and hard questions. In every interview he conducts, he really has the knack for getting to the bottom of issues, but then stepping aside to let readers make their own decisions.Overall, without going into the details, this is a great book for struggling Christians, or those who want to renew their faith from a logical, research-based perspective. Unless your heart is hardened and your mind irrevocably closed, this book has a great chance to make an incredible impression.",Investigates issues and doubts that can jeopardize one's faith.,"['Lee Strobel', 'Jane Vogel']",,['Juvenile Nonfiction']
Espresso! Starting and Running Your Own Coffee Business,3.0,"A good starter book, but lacks details","I agree with most of the other reviewers. If I were opening a coffee cart or kiosk I'd find this book educational. As it is, it lacks details but does give good basic information. You can start here but &quot;Become a coffee house owner&quot; is far more detailed, with business plans, budgets, specific list of items needed (down to the grease trap), contacts, employees, probably health requirements etc. I did gain some knowledge from this book, but it won't be a point of referral in the future.","Learn to start and run your own coffee bar with tips to brewing success The caffeine-lover in you has always wanted to start your own coffee bar--and all the guidance you'll need is right here in your hands! Order up a double shot of success with this guide packed to the brim with all things coffee and business.

Why Love Matters,5.0,Parenting Coach Welcomes Validation for Affection and Attention,"I'm recommending this book to all my clients. It provides a 'scientific' confirmation of parents' inner wisdom, and many people need that.Trusting and knowing how to access our own best instincts (and sometimes that instinct is to seek help from a professional or other outside source) are solid and effecive parenting tools. I'm glad to have more confirmation that learning to express love and affection in all its many forms to our offspring is the essence of good parenting.[...]","Why Love Matters explains why loving relationships are essential to brain development in the early years, and how these early interactions can have lasting consequences for future emotional and physical health. This second edition follows on from the success of the first, updating the scientific research, covering recent findings in genetics and the mind/body connection, and including a new chapter highlighting our growing understanding of the part also played by pregnancy in shaping a baby’s future emotional and physical well-being. The author focuses in particular on the wide-ranging effects of early stress on a baby or toddler’s developing nervous system. When things go wrong with relationships in early life, the dependent child has to adapt; what we now know is that his or her brain adapts too. The brain’s emotion and immune systems are particularly affected by early stress and can become less effective. This makes the child more vulnerable to a range of later difficulties such as depression, anti-social behaviour, addictions or anorexia, as well as physical illness.",['Sue Gerhardt'],Routledge,['Family & Relationships']
Aristophanes' Acharnians (Focus Classical Library),5.0,Two comedies by Aristophanes in Greek and English,"The Loeb Classical Library features the original Greek texts that remain for both of these comedies by Aristophanes and is obviously of great benefit to those who actually read Greek and are interested in playing with the translation in the hopes of arriving at a better understanding of these plays, their author and the time in which they were performed. The ""Acharnians"" is one of the earliest extant plays of Aristophanes, the winner of first prize at the festival when it was produced in 425 B.C. Dicaeopolis, a farmer tired of a war he considers to be stupid, decides to make an individual peace with the Spartans. However, before he can celebrate his private treaty, which allows him to trade for goods lacked by those in Athens, he is attacked by a chorus of Acharnian charcoal burners who support the war. The centerpiece of the comedy is Dicaeopolis's speech arguing the causes of the war are pretty stupid. This seriocomic speech, which is a parody of ""Telephus"" by Euripides, wins over half the chorus. Of course the other half immediately attacks them in a violent agon. The general Lamachus is called in to help, but Dicaeopolis destroys him with cutting arguments as well, and the chorus is united at the end to delivery Aristophanes's parabasis. Meanwhile, Discaeopolis has a drinking contest to attend, while Lamachus is sent back to the war. Pacificism and the folly of war are two recurring themes in the comedies of Aristophanes and both are explicit in the ""Acharnians."" It is also a good example of the standard format of a Greek comedy, at least as represented by the works of Aristophanes, including the giant party at the end.The Knights,"" produced in 424 B.C., is clearly an all-out attack on Cleon, the leader of Athens after the death of Pericles. As related by Thucydides, earlier that year Cleon had induced the Spartans to propose peace. Consequently, Aristophanes opens the comedy with two slaves of the crotchety old Demos (""the people of Athens"") dressed up to resemble the generals Demosthenes and Nicias. The two slaves complain about how everyone is picking on Paphlagon, a leather seller who is the favorite of Demos and clearly intended to be Cleon. The oracles tell that Paphlagon is going to be replaced by a sausage seller named Agoracritus. ""The Knights"" is a second-tier comedy by Aristophanes because it is devoted entirely to making fun of Cleon. Consequently, Aristophanes makes his point early on and by the time Agoracritus the sausage seller beats Cleon at this own game, the comic dramatist is beating a dead horse all the way into the ground. This comedy always struck me as being like a SNL skit that lasts the entire show. In the end Demos, rejuvenated by being stewed in a plot by Agoracritus, takes control and declares he will abolish all innovations and restore the old traditions.","English translation of Aristophanes' most popular comedy, with a lively, imaginative plot, memorable heroine, and appeal for peace and tolerance between nations and between the sexes. Includes helpful notes and an introductory essay on Aristophanes, the history of the play and its production, a bibliography and suggestions for further reading.","['Aristophanes', 'Jeffrey Henderson']",Focus,['Drama']
The hidden treasure of Glaston,5.0,A Long-Remembered Treasure,"What can I say about this sublime book that blends an exciting mystery with tantalizing folklore and fascinating historical detail? Only what virtually every other reviewer here has said:I read this book as a teen and never, ever forgot it.I became enthralled with the legends surrounding Glastonbury.I didn't rest until I actually visited the site in my 20's.I almost never write Amazon reviews, but I am so delighted to see this gem of a book available again, I had to check in.From the unanimously excited responses of those who rediscovered this book, I am confident that word of mouth and enthusiastic teachers and librarians will do everything they can to see that this amazing work reaches a new generation of future travellers to Glastonbury.Like I, they will be thrilled to gaze on the actual places described in the book: The beautiful Chalice Well, the ruined Abbey, the marker for ""Arthur's grave"", the thorn tree; and the profoundly mystical Glastonbury Tor at the nexus of one of the most remarkable places on Earth.Thank you, Eleanor Jewett, for making that trip a foregone conclusion for me upon the opening of your book.","Amidst great mystery, Hugh is left in the care of Glastonbury Abbey by his father who must flee England too swiftly to be burdened by a crippled son. Ashamed of his physical weakness, yet possessed of a stout heart, Hugh finds that life at the abbey is surprisingly full in this year 1171, in the turbulent days of King Henry II. Hugh, his friend Dickon and their strange friend, the mad Bleheris, uncover a treasure trove and with it a deeper mystery of the sort that could only occur in Glastonbury where Joseph of Arimithea was said to have lived out his last years.

Bridget Jones's Diary,1.0,Pathetic!,"Call me crazy but i didn't get this one. i am in my late twenties and dont see marriage in the near (or distant, for that matter) future so i thought id be able to relate to this one. Boy was I wrong! By the end of the novel I wanted to strangle Bridget AND the author. Ive never read of a more pathetic existence. I kept thinking that the &quot;main idea&quot; (think English class 8th grade) was that without a man, youre nothing. Do all of the readers who LOVED this one agree with that? that all women think about is men and calories? get real! the one thing this book did for me was make me feel good about myself becuase i DONT worry about those things constantly. If women genuinely resonated with this one, we've got some prioritizing to do.","Chronicles a year in the life of Bridget Jones, a single, thirtysomething woman on a perpetual quest for self-improvement, as she struggles to cope with relationships, weight control, and the other baffling complexities of modern life.",['Helen Fielding'],Penguin,['Fiction']
Record Breakers of the North Atlantic: Blue Riband Liners 1838-1952,5.0,"A wonderful, no-nonsense book with excellent text and art.","This 1999 German book, translated into English in 2000, is well balanced between informative text and wonderful art. It is illustrated with very nice black and white photographs and color drawings. Each ship covered is illustated with a side profile - I'm not certain, but each of these profiles looks like it is drawn to scale with all the others in the book, which visually shows how the shipbuilder's art has progressed over the years. Accompanying each profile for each ship is a specification of the ship and a brief career history.Note however, that the book is MUCH more than these little profiles - I just found them to be a nice added touch, just like I found the photographs of each man responsible for each ship's construction. The chapters are broken into into intelligent historical periods and the text and illustration captions are informative and smart.The book conveys the pride that the people (and governments!) associated with these vessels had for their ships. As the author states, the Blue Riband was never a formal competition. As a consequence, there never was an official history kept about it. However, this book does an excellent job of filling that void.","-- Beautifully presented, with 50 color illustrations and 120 black-and-white photos -- Written by the preeminent authority on the great age of transatlantic travel The Blue Riband, a mythical trophy for the fastest transatlantic crossing, has fascinated the public for almost 200 years. Although the race never officially existed, the battle for the Blue Riband was real. Five nations -- England, the United States, Germany, Italy, and France -- fiercely embraced the Old World-New World competition to produce the fastest ship on the high seas. Covering the early paddle steamers to the last great high-speed, four-screw turbine liners, foremost authority Arnold Kludas uses sumptuous illustrations and detailed text to tell the tale of rivalry and remarkable engineering that embraced the commercial motivation of the great shipping lines as well as the political ambitions of governments.",['Arnold Kludas'],Brassey's Incorporated,['Transportation']
Effective Communication for Colleges,2.0,DO NOT USE THIS TEXT,"I used both the previous edition and current edition of this text to teach college students. Both editions were full of errors and contradictory statements. In particular, you cannot rely on the instructor materials- there are many test questions that have answers that are contradicted in the text. Also, the grammar exercises are too difficult for an introductory text- they test students on advanced grammar concepts that are not even covered by the book! There is a grammar reference section at the end of the text but it does not cover the majority of concepts tested in the end-of-chapter grammar exercises. So, my students were continually frustrated. Many of the examples in the book are also very strange- for example, instead of PowerPoint, they speak of ""computer generated slides"".","Simply put, this new edition is power packed with just the right learning tools. Each chapter of EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION FOR COLLEGES (ECC), 11e, includes features that enhance learning and retention -- and promote more effective communication skills.","['Brantley', 'Clarice Pennebaker Brantley', 'Miller']",,['Business']

Ella Enchanted,5.0,write a senond one!,"When i read this book, I couldn't put it down, litterally. I'm a school student, and i was spending my recess reading this book. I was also so moved by the ending, that I wanted to turn the page and keep on reading about their marrage and their children. I really think the author should write a second part to this book.

Ruskin (Past Masters),5.0,An excellent introduction to the Ruskin way of seeing,"This book opens with a short biography of Ruskin, without going into in detail the difficulties of his life. It focuses on his way of seeing things, his path in perception in Art and Social Criticism. Landow claims that Ruskin thought by seeing and in this seeing also saw the symbolical and mythological meanings he valued in Art. Landow discusses Ruskin's championing and promoting of the work of J.M. Turner. He often cites that complicated Ruskin prose style which supposedly influenced among others Proust. He outlines Ruskin's social thought, his concern for the poor and presents Ruskin's unique conception of economics. For Ruskin wealth was not measured in money or possessions but ' fullness of life'. And Ruskin believed the great deprivation and social evil was not simply in material poverty but in loss of opportunity for cultural and spiritual enrichment. Ruskin is a visionary of Art and Social Reality, who saw both with the eyes of Tradition and with his own radical ideals of how to better reconstruct the world. Landow also indicates the very great influence of Ruskin in Victorian thought. As one who does not know Ruskin's work that well I felt this work gave me a clear idea of the main purpose and direction of a major nineteenth - century creative visionary.",,['George P. Landow'],,
Shane,5.0,One of the best five,"Howdy everyone, this is James Drury. I used to play The Virginian on NBC television, for those of you who can't remember that far back. It's that time again, time to read Shane. I'm only into it up to chapter six, and already those old memories have flooded back, and I recall why I love this book so much. It is timeless, to use a perhaps overused word. It is nearly a flawless book, although for the first time I've noticed that a few of his time elements are incredible, such as, for example, the time it takes Marion to bake a pie in the book. But this is such a good book that things like this don't matter. The only Western author I can truly say I enjoy as much as Jack Shaefer is Kirby Jonas, a young author whose books I read on audio for Books In Motion, who can be located at Booksinmotion.com . But in my opinion Shane can never be topped nor matched by anyone. If you are a young person and feel forced into reading this book, I wish I could tell your teachers, &quot;Don't force Shane on anyone!&quot; This book should be read in your leisure time, when YOU want to, to be truly enjoyed. I hope you will give it an honest chance.","This bibulous, drug-indulgent and anarchic rock legend was born on a small farm in Tipperary, won a scholarship to Westminster, was rapidly expelled, became a rent boy, then a central figure of punk and the hugely influential star of The Pogues. MacGowan's music, innovative and powerful, is as distinctive as his chaotic, breakdown-scarred, drug and alcohol-fuelled lifestyle.

Five O'Clock Shadow (Dan Mahoney Mysteries),2.0,Had Potential...,"I really enjoyed the outline of the story as laid out in the book jacket -- it had such potential! But the writing needed editing AND the lead character was so inconsistent I don't think I could keep track! Also, at the very end (no spoiler since this will be vague), I was quite upset that the priest was more upset about this brothers actions than those of children! Disgusting! I don't know who to blame more -- the author or the editor because I think this book could have really been a crazy, wacky story with the right editing!","From an author described by Kirkus as “lively, surprising” comes Five O’Clock Shadow with its puzzler of a plot tied to colorful New Mexico. As the great balloon bearing the image of a clock swoops across the River Grande, Pauly Caton watches her husband of four days fall from the sky. Who is the naked child who scrambles from the gondola when it strikes a sandbar and flees? Did she just imagine it? Why would he have been up with Randy and the pilot on the honeymoon ride she was too chicken to join? Who, in fact, was meant to die? And meant to die it was — her hastily snapped photos of the scene show a masked sharpshooter stationed high up in a tree. As Pauly tries to put her shattered life together, she discovers the lies. The first in the morgue. How else had Randy deceived her? Had he told her anything that was the truth? Were his partners in their get-rich company any more honest? Pauly knows she hadn’t signed any of the documents the lawyer presents to her. Maybe she’ll insist on becoming an active partner. Pauly’s flamboyant Grams, the much-married carnival queen, offers her only grandchild a place to recover, a retreat on Albuquerque’s west side that’s home to fifty odd folks complete with clowns, a handsome tattoo man — and the snakes. And then Pauly finds out she’s rich — money that she swears could not have been Randy’s. Where did he get it? Who was the son he apparently adopted? A trip to El Paso uncovers more mysterious acts and points her towards the truth. But will she live long enough to find it?

LEST INNOCENT BLOOD BE SHED,4.0,Stunning,"I read this last summer, and I wish I had written this review when it was still fresh in my mind.It is the wonderful story of Le Chambon, a poor French Protestant (Calvinist) village of 3,000 that successfully hid 2,500-5,000 Jews from the Gestapo and Vichy for the entire occupation. The author (Jewish philosopher) shows that the Calvinism of the villagers led them to risk everything to rescue Jewish strangers. Beautiful portraits of Pastor Trocme, his Italian wife, the theologian/physician Le Forestier (who worked with Schweitzer, but left to work with Trocme), etc. Incredible picture of the violence of the Resistance (and sad infighting). Stark contrast to incredible principles of the pacifist Trocme et al.Writing style is overwrought, even goofy, at points, and longwinded, but this book will push a Christian to feel why Christ matters.","During the most terrible years of World War II, when inhumanity and political insanity held most of the world in their grip and the Nazi domination of Europe seemed irrevocable and unchallenged, a miraculous event took place in a small Protestant town in southern France called Le Chambon. There, quietly, peacefully, and in full view of the Vichy government and a nearby division of the Nazi SS, Le Chambon's villagers and their clergy organized to save thousands of Jewish children and adults from certain death.",['Philip P.

When Wilber realizes he is going to be slaughtered for Christmas dinner, Charlotte says that she is going to save him, and she does. They become best friends, who really would do almost anything for eachother.I liked this book because it showed how friends are willing to save one another.

When most of us think of magic, we picture a man in a black cape sawing a woman in half, or a sleight-of-hand card trick. But there's another kind of magic – real magic – that can enrich your life. According to Dyer, real magic means creating miracles in everyday life. Quitting smoking or drinking, achieving new Job success, or finding a happy relationship – these are all miracles because they transcend our perceived limitations. From ""creating a miracle mind-set"" and achieving change in the areas of personal health, prosperity, and fulfilling love relationships to believing in the magic of miracles on a global scale, Dyer shows us that miracles within our reach and within our own minds. In Real Magic, Dyer teaches us how to achieve a higher level of consciousness. He asks us to imagine what would make us happy, then offers specific strategies for attaining these goals. In every aspect of our individual lives – physical health, finances, intimate relationships, and personal identity – there is always room for a miracle or two.

The Stand. The Complete and Uncut Edition,5.0,The BEST book I've ever read period.,"Whether it be horror, suspense, mystery, comedy, etc Stephen King's The Stand is the very best and well written book I've ever had the pleasure of reading. It surpassed all expectations and after a quick 1140 pages I was left wanting more. I wondered how King would end such a huge novel but it was quite satisfying. I am a growing SK fan and was initially intimidated by the length of this book. Don't be. It's actually a very quick read. It took me just over a week to finish and I consider myself a slow reader.","When a disease wipes out most of humankind, the survivors gather to create a new society and to battle a force of pure evil in human form unleashed upon the world.

Radical Innovation: How Mature Companies Can Outsmart Upstarts,5.0,GREAT Information for ALL companies - Upstart and Mature,"Very succinct yet comprehensive. It has key advice on the marketing, finance, and people skills necessary to see a new idea advance to a great new product. This book should be required reading for all MBA students, managers, and anyone who has the dream of a great new idea but is unsure as to how to make it come real. Although the title states that the book focuses on how more established companies can create environments to promote radical innovations, the information can readily be applied to any firm regardless of length of operations - and yes, to individuals.The authors present a list of 7 challenges that face the radical innovator and then they provide the competencies, or skills, that are necessary to meet these challenges. Throughout the text, real-life examples from well-known firms help the reader to understand how these challenges come about, and to even recognize a challenge should it present itself. The examples do tend to focus on radical innovations that are new technological products, but the recommendations could also be applied to other new ideas such as new management systems or organizational structures.","Based on evidence from a five-year, real time study of twelve radical innovation projects within ten major corporations - including General Electric, IBM, Nortel Networks, DuPont, and Texas Instruments - this book addresses seven managerial challenges large companies face in creating and sustaining radical innovation.","['Richard Leifer', 'Christopher M.

True Believer (Large Print),2.0,Dumb,"Normally, I love Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one is not great. It is incredibly slow, and the whole book could be written in about 30 pages.","Part love story and part ghost story, this is an unforgettable New York Times bestseller about a science journalist and a North Carolina librarian who dare to believe in the impossible.

In Cold Blood: A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences,5.0,Talented Writer,Truman Capote is ranked with John Steinbeck and Jack London as a literary giant. His ability to tell a story is genius. This book is riveting.,"'Dick became convinced that Perry was that rarity, 'a natural killer'- absolutely sane, but conscienceless, and capable of dealing, with or without motive, the coldest-blooded deathblows' On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, a wealthy farmer, his wife and their two young children were found brutally murdered. Blood all over the walls, the telephone lines cut, and only a few dollars stolen. Heading up the investigation is Agent Al Dewey, but all he has are two footprints, four bodies, and a whole lot of questions. Truman Capote's detailed reconstruction of the events and consequences of that fateful night, In Cold Blood is a chilling, gripping mix of journalistic skill and imaginative power.

The Stanley Kubrick Archives,5.0,Worth the weight (and price),"While Kubrick has been gone for years, his films remain a testatment to how good and how diverse the work of a single director can be.The Stanley Kubrick Archives is an unsurpassed collection of a life's work, perfectly broken into two distinct sections.The first section undertakes a belief of Stanley's that (I'm paraphrasing poorly)""the image should speak for itself"". This sees all of Kubrick's films being given the storyboard treatment (sans ANY text) with perfectly-graded stills from all the key scenes from all of his films. Truly, when looking over 2001's stunning imagery, it's impossible not to hear the classical soundtrack playing in your head.The second section is the truly archival section of the book with in-depth analysis given to all of Kubrick's titles plus some of his work prior to becoming a feature filmaker. Projects unrealised by Kubrick himself, such as A.I. and Napoleon, are also given some print. This section is a wealth of information that will delight for years to come.While the price & weight of the book (it's staggeringly heavy but comes in a cool-as cardboard carry case) are great, this is money well spent by any enthusiast of quality films. While Kubrick's films were not all masterpieces, as the present overall quality of film seems to be on the decline, his body of work is certainly worth remembering.","This special anniversary-edition work explores Stanley Kubrick's archives. With selected articles and essays and extensive film notes, this work offers the most comprehensive study of the filmmaker to date.","['Alison Castle', 'Stanley Kubrick', 'Jan Harlan', 'Christiane Kubrick']",Taschen America Llc,['Performing Arts']
I Feel Bad About My Neck: And Other Thoughts on Being a Woman,4.0,The Aftermath Of Fifty,"Oh, I enjoyed this book. I had to find a quiet corner to read this book because I kept giggling and smiling to myself. When I found myself laughing out loud at the candid humour of the lines, I knew I had to hide somewhere where no one could see me laughing to myself. Ah, it's so true - how we ladies would slog in front of the mirror sometimes just to feel confident stepping out of the house. I would recommend this book to my friends who are fifty and above.","A collection of essays offers a humorous look at the ups and downs of being a woman of a certain age, discussing the tribulations of maintenance and trying to stop the clock, menopause, and empty nests.",['Nora Ephron'],Vintage,['Humor']
We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book),2.0,Let's Get To the Point,"This book drove me crazy. You must read 100 pages to fine out what the book is about. It's obvious that the author likes to write and write and write. Meanwhile, the reader gets lost more than once wondering what is going on!! I did not like the Mulvaneys. What kind of mother would send her only daughter, a true victum, away and stay with her selfish, drunken husband? It seems as though she did not have any compassion at all! And this was a GOOD family???? I just finished &quot;Sing Me A Bawdy Song&quot; and it is a truly great book that moves along. It is fun to read and does not drag on and on and on.","Moving away from the dark tone of her more recent masterpieces, Joyce Carol Oates turns the tale of a family struggling to cope with its fall from grace into a deeply moving and unforgettable account of the vigor of hope and the power of love to prevail over suffering. The Mulvaneys of High Point Farm in Mt. Ephraim, New York, are a large and fortunate clan, blessed with good looks, abundant charisma, and boundless promise. But over the twenty-five year span of this ambitious novel, the Mulvaneys will slide, almost imperceptibly at first, from the pinnacle of happiness, transformed by the vagaries of fate into a scattered collection of lost and lonely souls. It is the youngest son, Judd, now an adult, who attempts to piece together the fragments of the Mulvaneys' former glory, seeking to uncover and understand the secret violation that occasioned the family's tragic downfall. Each of the Mulvaneys endures some form of exile -- physical or spiritual -- but in the end they find a way to bridge the chasms that have opened up among them, reuniting in the spirit of love and healing. Profoundly cathartic, Oates' acclaimed novel unfolds as if, in the darkness of the human spirit, she has come upon a source of light at its core. Rarely has a writer made such a startling and inspiring statement about the value of hope and compassion. ""What keeps us coming back to Oates Country is her uncanny gift of making the page a window, with something happening on the other side that we'd swear was like life itself"". -- The New York Times Book Review ""A major achievement that stands with Oates' finest studies of American life...the novel is a testament to the tenacious bonds of the family, therestorative power of love and capacity to endure and prevail"". -- The Chicago Tribune",['Joyce Carol Oates'],,
Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl,5.0,Better than I even remembered,"Although I read this originally in seventh grade English class, re-reading this as an adult was even more moving. When I was twelve I didn't know what words like 'Gestapo' meant or 'The Third Reich'...in fact, I hadn't grasped the magnitude of The Holocaust until I was much older. There were so many ways that at twelve-years-old I could connect with Anne Frank, but as an adult (although the same pre-teen connections were there), my perception of who Anne Frank was changed drastically. I had been fascinated by her diary since I was twelve, and visited The Secret Annex in The Netherlands twice in an eighteen-month span. I strongly recommend to anyone who had a fascination with Anne Frank when they were younger, to read it again as an adult.","Anne Frank hield van 12 juni 1942 tot 1 augustus 1944 een dagboek bij. Zij schreef haar brieven alleen voor zichzelf, tot ze in de lente van 1944 op radio Oranje de minister van Onderwijs, Kunsten en Wetenschappen in ballingschap, Bolkestein, hoorde spreken. Hij zei dat na de oorlog alle getuigenissen van het lijden van het Nederlandse volk onder de Duitse bezetting verzameld en openbaar moesten worden gemaakt. Als voorbeeld noemde hij onder andere dagboeken. Onder de indruk van deze redevoering besloot Anne Frank na de oorlog een boek te publiceren. Haar dagboek zou daarvoor als basis dienen. In maart 1945 stierf Anne Frank op vijftienjarige leeftijd in het concentratiekamp Bergen-Belsen. De enige overlevende van de familie, Otto Frank, zorgde ervoor dat het dagboek van zijn dochter toch gepubliceerd werd. In 1947 verscheen Het Achterhuis. Het is sindsdien een van de meest gelezen boeken ter wereld. Het is in meer dan dertig landen verschenen en er zijn meer dan zestien miljoen exemplaren van verkocht. ""Eén enkele Anne Frank ontroert ons meer dan de ontelbaren die net zo leden als zij, maar wier beeld in de schaduw is gebleven. Misschien moet dat ook zo zijn: als we het leed van alle mensen moesten en konden meelijden, zouden we niet kunnen leven."" Primo Levi",['Anne Frank'],Prometheus,['Biography & Autobiography']
Dragonsblood,4.0,Needs an Open Mind,"With so many books in the series it can be hard to come up with a completely original plot line. As has been noted in history books, movie reviews, and the other reviews of this book, there are some plot areas that have been used previously, both in this series and others. Dragonsblood does have several hanging plots (the ship scene, the green dragon rider, and others). There are some historical inconsistencies between this book and the others. It has happened in the books Anne wrote and doubtless will occur in any future books written for the series. I was struck by the way that the book was written to show how portions of the future (read the first books in the series) may have come about or were influenced by events in the past. I noticed also that there is some attempt to make apologies and restitution or excuses for events that occured in Pern's first days (read the later books). Many have focused on the watch-wher conundrum. All I will say on the subject is that if you pay attention, even in the last days of the First Pass the creatures are already misunderstood and treated poorly. It is not so impossible for them to be almost completely removed from the Thread defense equation over the centuries and millenia of Pern's history. Our own history clearly shows that even with a written history and well known tribal knowledge some things are still inevitably lost or forgotten. The book does well to show that even the mighty dragons are not invulnerable to disease and some human failings. This book is obviously an early effort book for a new author. Not even Anne's books in the beginning were instant classics. Dragonsblood with its mistakes and some inovations serves to both show more of Pern's history and open the possiblities for more books. This book is definitely love or hate both because of the series it has been written for and the newness of the writer with his attendant mistakes. Try it at the library first if you must. As for myself, I buy every Pern book.","With the dragons of Pern dying and the only person who can save them long dead, the grieving dragonriders find clues in the lyrics of an ancient ballad to long-forgotten knowledge and secrets hidden somewhere in Benden Weyr, but to save the dragons, one young woman must make the ultimate sacrifice.

"Bloody Ground (The Starbuck Chronicles, Volume 4)(Library Edition)",5.0,On Better Ground,"Bernard Cornwell breathes so much life back into history that with BLOODY GROUND is book #4 in the Starbuck Chronicles he should be listed on the Red Cross CPR list on Top Ten Pulse Givers! Yeah, I know...there's no such title but once you read your way into one of his series you begin to see and feel history in a new light. With BLOODY GROUND you get the American Civil War and the build up to Gettysburg. The war is building with intensity and with book #4 we are in the thick of the fight at Sharpsburg and Cornwell places us right along side of those who were there. Is it fiction? Yes, the best kind because it brings meaning back to the battle sites where thousand died for causes only they could best define. Nate Starbuck has his reasons for fighting for the Confederacy and Cornwell makes them as complex as only real life can be.Awhile back I think there was a push to build a theme park at one of the major Civil War battle sites but it fell by the wayside due to public outcry and protest. Cornwell's fine series offers us a look at why the ground deserves something better than souped up carnival rides or hawkers selling overpriced 'It's a small, slave world' T-shirts.What was lost there and what was gained needs to be preserved.A good read.","A superbly exciting novel which vividly captures the horror of the battlefield, The Bloody Ground is the fourth volume in the Starbuck Chronicles.",['Bernard Cornwell'],HarperCollins UK,['Fiction']
Thousand and One Night Stands : The Life of Jon Vincent,5.0,Excellent book about a major figure in erotic films,"A truly excellent biography.Jon Vincent was handsome, driven and talented. He was extremely charming and seductive -- a man who could persuade nearly anyone to do nearly anything. He had the talent to succeed in major league baseball, perhaps the looks and talent to succeed in Hollywood, and was phenomenally successful as an actor in gay/bisexual adult films.Vincent was a thrill junkie: a compulsive seeker of sexual adventure, physical danger, steroids, alcohol, cocaine and finally heroin. Heroin was stronger than he was; it took over his life and finally killed him.H.A. Carson recounts Vincent's life. The book is a narrative: the judgements expressed are those made by Vincent himself. It is seems lurid in places, but only because certain aspects of Vincent's life were lurid. The book has photos of Vincent in his prime, which will appeal to his fans.Heroin addiction is a cliche in our culture. Few readers will be surprised at the downward spiral of poverty, prostitution, deception, theft, arrest, futile detoxification efforts, near-fatal drug overdoses, delusion, paranoia, despair, homelessness and eventual death -- although the details are often startling and chilling.However, there is much in this book that the average reader is not likely to know. I was unaware, for example, that a detoxifying junkie (going cold turkey) can experience 30 or more days of near-absolute insomnia. The book reveals aspects of junkie life that are odd (the Geographical theory ofsobriety), disturbing (the link between pornography, prostitution and drug addiction; the tendency for heroin addiction to spread among friends like a common cold) and very disturbing (the devastation that addicts inflict on those who love them and want to help them).The book shows how heroin addiction is a day-by-day, night-by-night battle to stay alive. Jon Vincent was victorious in many of his daily battles; but eventually, there was always defeat and readdiction.The book is a damned good read, a powerful anti-drug message, and also a perfect place to start for anyone curious or concerned about pornography, prostitution, drug addiction or addictive personalities in general. One bad point: it is available as a paperback only, not in hardcover (I have checked).","A recurring dream involving the drowning of a six-year old draws us to the scene fifty years later in ""The Red Mitten."" ""The Missing"" begins as a humorous look at substitute teaching until a laid-back sub discovers something bizarre about students mysteriously dropping out of high school.

Included is a pair of exciting WWII dramas ""The Foxhole""and ""The Treasure of St.Antoine"" (a story of the French Resistance with a plot to assassinate The Desert Fox, Erwin Rommel). ""The Liar's Club"" takes a traveling salesman in the dead of winter through a desolate part of eastern Maine to a small village that isn't even on the map.

"Doctor Danger Forward: A World War II Memoir of a Combat Medical Aidman, First Infantry Division",5.0,A snapshot of history,Towne has given us a firsthand account of many of the significant American battles of WWII from a combat medic's perspective. This memoir is a must read for anyone interested in getting a factual historical glimpse of WWII.,"As a combat medical aidman of Company B, 1st Medical Battalion, First Infantry Division, Allen N. Towne experienced some of the pivotal events of World War II. “Doctor B,” as his unit was known, was attached to the 18th Regimental Combat Team and moved with them, providing continuous close medical support. Covering both little-known engagements, and such historic moments as the campaign in Sicily and the D Day landings at Omaha Beach, this book is both a memoir and a history of one of the war’s most impressive units. The text is based on both official “morning reports” and the author’s personal notes, providing accuracy as well as human insight. In Doctor Danger Forward (“danger forward” was the code name of the First Division headquarters), Towne, who received the Bronze Star and Oak Leaf Cluster for his heroism at Omaha Beach and Normandy, chronicles events both epic and intimate, profoundly serious as well as humorous.

Operation Trojan Horse,5.0,An Honest Voice in the Midst of the Paranormal Wilderness,Between the modern Inquisition of CSICOP and the pseudo-mystical/religious cults of UFO buffs stands John Keel.

A strong dose of critical thinking and a needed tonic between head-in-the-sand skepticism and believe-all ET religions.,"OUR SKIES ARE FILLED WITH TROJAN HORSES... ""The real UFO story must encompass all of the many manifestations being observed. It is a story of ghosts and phantoms and strange mental aberrations; of an invisible world that surrounds us and occasionally engulfs us; of prophets and prophecies, and gods and demons. It is a world of illusion and hallucination where the unreal seems very real, and where reality itself is distorted by strange forces which can seemingly manipulate space, time, and physical matter¿forces that are almost entirely beyond our powers of comprehension."" John A. Keel (March 25, 1930 ¿ July 3, 2009) was an American journalist and influential UFOlogist best known as the author of ""The Mothman Prophecies."" In the mid-1960s, he took up investigating UFOs and assorted forteana and published his first knockout UFO book, Operation Trojan Horse, in 1970. The book shredded the then trendy nuts-and-bolts extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs in favor of one that linked UFOs to a variety of paranormal and supernatural phenomena that have taken place throughout history. Keel was one of the first to note that the UFO phenomenon appears in different disguises¿and that one could not begin to decipher this great mystery without first taking into account its many and varied deliberate deceptions.",['John A.

The Rape of the Lock,5.0,Funny!,"My version of the poem had a great introduction which explained what inspired the poem, which was a huge bonus for me! Alexander Pope's poem however was easy enough for me to understand, which I greatly appreciate. I particularly loved the description of the women being dressed at the end of the first canto. There was something so profound in the statement that the women take praise for looking good when it isn't them that look good - it was those that dressed them. Granted, I suspect that most women don't have someone dressing them these days; however, today women are so covered in makeup, and with the prevalence of plastic surgery and botox, I'm not sure that we really are making ourselves look good anymore, it's something else.Regardless, the poem was actually quite wonderful. Funny, quirky, and clever - overall I loved it! It amused me how he instilled this sense of impending doom and horror into a comedic poem about a woman's hair being cut off as a prank at a party. Knowing the back-story was tremendously helpful in this regard, it I had not known that it was written in response to a prank played at a party, I would have greatly misunderstood the poem.","First published in 1971.

Future Men,4.0,Principally sober,"I have sons, how do I prepare them?Future Men is an excellent read for knowing the basic principles that a father should under-gird his son with. It touches numerous topics such as girls, fighting, work, money, and laziness. The author, Douglas Wilson, begins by defining the obstacles that prevent boys from becoming Godly men, then enlists the fathers to take up the responsibility God has given them in the raising of a son, and finishes with several chapters on key topics, as mentioned above.I found this book to be principly sober. This book was short and concise, consisting mostly of biblical principles that sons must know and fathers must teach. Biblically, this book, was aligned correctly with the Word of God. I found all of Mr. Wilson's points to be exegetically correct and applied aply to any and all issues of our sons. Each chapter was short and carefully outlined in such a way that referencing it in the future for quick review on a certain issue is helpful. The book began and ended by establishing the truth that men are to be obedient to God. In fact, every chapter alluded to this very basic and absolutely essential truth - men are called to be obedient to God.If you are looking for a book with very practical applications to it, this is not the book. The principles outlined on each topic allow for personal digestion and personal application. For instance, Mr. Wilson does not advocate a certain type of education for our sons over another, i.e. homeschooling is better than public. He lays out the truth of what our sons need and then rightly applies the implications -fathers are to make sure their sons know the proper truth as future men.My favorite moment in the book was in the chapter on Christian Liberty. He carefully laid out the truth that Christian liberty is for the service of another, not our own personal self-will. We do have the liberty with certain practices, as mature adults distinguishing between good and evil. We are to train our sons to be able to distinguish the same and not give into their appetites for their own glutoness passions. As he closes out the chapter he tells the reader that wine makes a heart glad and that a father is to train his son to enjoy a glass of wine responsibly. He is not hypocritical in his position, just balanced and led by the truths of Scripture.I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any father who needs a basic primer on the principles that are necessary for the training of our future men.I recieved this book from Canon Press for free in exchange for my review. I am not required to give a positive review and the opinions expressed are my own.","How do we build our sons to be tough but not arrogant? mannered but not soft? imaginative but not lazy? bold but not hollow? Future Men is a Christian guide to raising strong, virtuous sons, contrary to the effeminacy and sentimentalism of contemporary culture. When Theodore Roosevelt taught Sunday school for a time, a boy showed up one Sunday with a black eye. He admitted he had been fighting and on a Sunday too. He told the future president that a bigger boy had been pinching his sister, and so he fought him. TR told him that he had done perfectly right and gave him a dollar. The stodgy vestrymen thought this was a bit much, and so they let their exuberant Sunday school teacher go. What a loss. Unbelief cannot look past surfaces. Unbelief squashes; faith teaches. Faith takes a boy aside and tells him that this part of what he did was good, while the other part of what he did got in the way. ""And this is how to do it better next time."" As we look to Scripture for patterns of masculinity for our sons, we find them manifested perfectly in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the one who set the ultimate pattern for friendship, for courage, for faithfulness, and integrity.",['Douglas Wilson'],,['Boys']
Debating Slavery: Economy and Society in the Antebellum American South (New Studies in Economic and Social History),2.0,A Dull Primer on the Historiography of Slavery,"In 'Debating Slavery', Mark M. Smith has made quite an achievement: he took two topics which I personally find fascinating - American Negro Slavery and Historiography - and managed to produce a sordid essay, that is almost entirely unenlightening and literally painful to read.Smith's book exposes the opinions of scholars of slavery on several key questions about the 'peculiar institution': Was slavery profitable? Were slave owners Capitalists? And to what extent did the owners control the life and culture of slaves?Smith's answer to all these questions seems to be a variation on 'to an extent'. Slaveholders were part Capitalist and part not Capitalists, and what is Capitalism anyway? The Slaves had their own culture but where very influenced by the masters, etc. I don't mind ambiguity and nuance in analysis, but Smith comes off not as complex but as indecisive.It doesn't help that Smith's narrative is little more then a list of scholars's opinions, along with citations and reference. There are some attempts to flash out the argument (often using graphs and charts), but those are halfhearted. Smith seems to think that reference is a substitute for an argument.In what is essentially an extended bibliographical essay, one would expect a useful list of works sited. Unfortunately, even that is not properly done. After a short list of 'general books', Smith goes on to put a separate bibliography for each chapter, without repeating titles. As a result, if you are trying to locate a reference to a book in chapter five, for instance, you may have to look through the bibliographies of all the preceding chapters, as the work you're looking for may be mentioned in any of them.All in all, Debating Slavery is a mercilessly bad book.

"The Wisdom of Crowds: Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few and How Collective Wisdom Shapes Business, Economies, Societies and Nations",4.0,"Just when the ""crowd"" was getting dissed...along comes Surowiecki","James Surowiecki writes a brilliant and often provocative business column in The New Yorker, and he applies a challenging attitude in everything he writes: turning a 700 word case study very often into a powerful big idea.Here he argues that far from being a mindless herd of idiots, the collective wisdom of a group of people can very often (not always) outshine the work of experts who know the subject. The author calls on a series of rather good case studies to argue the point - for example the way the public punished Thiokol in the sharemarket long before the cause of the Challenger explosion had even been established. (And without any influence from insider trading.) How does the collective gut instinct get this kind of thing so right? And how does the Hollywood Stock Exchange HSX pick tomorrow's hit movies so accurately - before these films ever get released? I'm sure a few movie moguls would kill to have such an accurate track record as the ""mindless public.""Surowiecki sets out a number of conditions that facilitate the wisdom of crowds, and explains why sometimes the public doesn't get things so right.I'm far from the only market researcher who has reviewed this book, and from a professional point of view the volume counterbalances a lot of argument we hear about how the public, or public polls get things ""so wrong, so often."" In essence the book offers a vote of confidence in the common-sense of the public.However let's not ignore that there are counter-arguments to Surowiecki's case, and I wasn't satisfied that the author had explored these ideas. For example I've read scientific journals that suggest that group-decisions are usually smarter than individual decisions purely because a group has a greater chance of containing at least one expert within its ranks - but this idea isn't raised or argued here.Towards the end of the book I had a palpable sense that the author had run out of energy: the main points, and Surowiecki's characteristic vitality are evident more in the first half.I give the volume four stars though. The Wisdom of Crowds forms an important part of the jigsaw of understanding how today's networked, internetted society really functions. I enjoyed this book immensely. Power to the people!","Looks at the theory that large groups have more collective intelligence than a smaller number of experts, drawing on a wide range of disciplines to offer insight into such topics as politics, business, and the environment.",,Anchor,['Social Science']
Leaves of grass,5.0,great thinker of his time,"WALT WHITMAN FOUND AWAY THRU WORDS TO EXPRESS LIFE,LOVE,AND FEELINGS MOST MORTAL MEN CAN NOT.TO LIVE FREE,LOVE FREE.WHEN I AM GONE LOOK FOR ME ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BOOT SOLE.HE WENT PAST OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LOVE AND DEATH.TO READ THIS BOOK ,IS TO GREATER UNDERSTAND OURSELVES,IN AWAY TODAY WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THE TIME TO SEE.","Leaves of Grass is a poetry collection by the American poet Walt Whitman (1819–1892). Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent his entire life writing and re-writing Leaves of Grass, revising it in several editions until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades—the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400 poems.The poems of Leaves of Grass are loosely connected and each represents Whitman's celebration of his philosophy of life and humanity. This book is notable for its discussion of delight in sensual pleasures during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass (particularly the first edition) exalted the body and the material world. Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman's poetry praises nature and the individual human's role in it. However, much like Emerson, Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit; rather, he elevates the human form and the human mind, deeming both worthy of poetic praise.",['Walt Whitman'],Createspace Independent Pub,['Poetry']

A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library),5.0,Great for Home School needs,"I home school my daughter and was looking for some works by American authors. When I decided on Mark Twain it was great to be able to get something other than Tom Sawyer. The book was easy to find, affordable, and exactly what I was looking for. The Kindle is easy to transport so the book can go anywhere in a purse and be read at anytime (even at night under the covers with no flashlight).","Hank Morgan awakens one morning to find he has been transported from nineteenth-century New England to sixth-century England and the reign of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Morgan brings to King Arthur’s utopian court the ingenuity of the future, resulting in a culture clash that is at once satiric, anarchic, and darkly comic. Critically deemed one of Twain’s finest and most caustic works, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court is both a delightfully entertaining story and a disturbing analysis of the efficacy of government, the benefits of progress, and the dissolution of social mores. It remains as powerful a work of fiction today as it was upon its first publication in 1889.",['Mark Twain'],Modern Library,['Fiction']

Liquid Pleasures: A Social History of Drinks in Modern Britain,3.0,"A fun read, full of facts and figures.","This is really a fun read, covering British drinking habits, alchoholic and otherwise. It purports to cover several centuries but is really mostly about the late 18th century to the early 20th. My only major gripe is that it is based entirely on secondary sources -other people's work. So as a survey it is very useful, but really doesn't contribute anything new to the scholarship. It is also clearly written by a social scientist -lots of tables and figures, and even the text decribes trends quantitatively. For the qualitative-minded, we are rarely given more than anecdotes about why culturally shifts in national preferences occured. These tend to be obscured by heaps of evidence drawn from new laws, import duties, and marketing schemes. All in all, pleasant reading, but patience with numbers is required.","Drinking has always meant much more than satisfying the thirst. Drinking can be a necessity, a comfort, an indulgence or a social activity. Liquid Pleasures is an engrossing study of the social history of drinks in Britain from the late seventeenth century to the present. From the first cup of tea at breakfast to mid-morning coffee, to an eveining beer and a 'night-cap', John Burnett discusses individual drinks and drinking patterns which have varied not least with personal taste but also with age, gender, region and class. He shows how different ages have viewed the same drink as either demon poison or medicine. John Burnett traces the history of what has been drunk in Britain from the 'hot beverage revolution' of the late seventeenth century - connecting drinks and related substances such as sugar to empire - right up to the 'cold drinks revolution' of the late twentieth century, examining the factors which have determined these major changes in our dietary habits.","['Proffessor John Burnett', 'John Burnett']",Routledge,['History']

The Red Balloon,5.0,A beautifully produced picture book of the 1950's children's classic short film.,"For anyone, who, like myself, went to see The Red Balloon at the cinema as a child in 1957, this beautifully designed and superbly produced book is a perfect souvenir of this multi-award winning Technicolor short film that remains as totally enchanting today as it was fifty years ago, when I was entranced by it as a ten year old boy.When a film is in production, very many still photographs are taken during the shoot for use as publicity material later on. This book contains no less than 39 black and white location stills and seven in full colour, or nine if you count the front and back covers, making a total of 48 photographs as beautifully crisp and clear today as they were when they were first taken, a lifetime ago, way back in 1956. Accompanying the photographs is the storyline of the film, told page by page and still by still and this is beautifully written.The Red Balloon, directed by Albert Lamorisse, running only 35 minutes, without dialogue and telling its story though pictures, sound and music, tells the fable of a lonely little six year old Parisian boy, Pascal (played by the director's young son, Pascal Lamorisse), who befriends an equally lonely helium filled red balloon with a life of its own, which becomes his constant companion, following him everywhere, waiting outside school for him and even outside his bedroom. The two become devoted to one another and share many adventures together. For Pascal, the red balloon becomes the friend that he's always yearned for.At the end, a group of school bullies, jealous of the happiness that Pascal and the balloon have found together, waylay the little boy and throw stones and fire catapults at the balloon, puncturing it. As the balloon slowly falls to the ground and dies in front of a heartbroken Pascal, all the balloons of Paris come to its funeral, lifting Pascal up over the Paris skyline and upward into Heaven, where Pascal and his beloved red balloon will be together forever. So very beautifully done and so very, very moving. An absolute children's classic.The film and the location photographs in this book are also a unique record of a long lost part of Paris. A Technicolor record of the Belleville area of the city, which was razed to the ground during the 1960's, left as waste land for twenty years and then converted into a modern day park. 99% of what you see in the film, including the bakery, the famous Y shaped staircase, ect, exist no more. One or two shots are taken in Montmartre but the rest of the film was shot in the Belleville area of Paris and the adjacent quartier des Pyrenees. Only the large church seen in the film and also in this book remains today, dwarfed by the high rise blocks erected in the 1970's.I highly recommend this book to anyone of any age who appreciates something of a very high quality. Not just those of us who are approaching sixty now and have very fond memories of the film from our 1950's childhood, but to anyone of any age. 5 out of 5. From David Rayner in Stoke on Trent, England.",,,,
The Persian Puzzle: The Conflict Between Iran and America,4.0,informative and easy to read,"I don't agree with everything Pollack puts forward in this book. However, I think he has the experience that warrants people giving him a fair shot. I consider myself a moderate and that's how Pollack comes across in this book. I also think that just because he was wrong about one thing (and his company in this group is quite vast), doesn't mean this book is not helpful.I should say first that if you're expecting an Iranian history book, you should probably look elsewhere. There is a fair amount of history here, but the book's primary focus is documenting Iran's relationship with the U.S. Some reviewers below claim that Pollack's history is kind of murky. I haven't read enough about Iran to judge those statements, but Pollack has quite a long track record of dealing with Iran from inside the U.S. government, and as such his description and explanation of events goes a long way if you're tyring to understand Washington's policy towards Iraq.One area where Pollack can be faulted I think is when he goes off on side talks about Iraq and how the U.S. was handling that country during the 90's. Now to be sure, Pollack is not the only author I've read that has done this, but that's no excuse, and also as someone working in the government he knows darn well that the U.S. was violating the spirit of the same UN resolutions at the same time Iraq was. The question this raises for me is ""if he's not being fully honest about this, how reliable is he about Iran?"" Well, the unfortunate answer is that we don't know how accurate all the information is that we get in books like this. It is our responsibility to read as much as possible and then try to determine the truth. Again, it's sad but true so get over it and read a few books. You'll be better off for it anyway.Overall, I think Pollack has produced a good book. His recommendations for Iran are helpful and I really think he puts all the available options on the table and argues convincingly for what he thinks is best. Should you read other books about Iran? Yes. Is this one a bad place to start? No.","In his highly influential book The Threatening Storm, bestselling author Kenneth Pollack both informed and defined the national debate about Iraq. Now, in The Persian Puzzle, published to coincide with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Iran hostage crisis, he examines the behind-the-scenes story of the tumultuous relationship between Iran and the United States, and weighs options for the future. Here Pollack, a former CIA analyst and National Security Council official, brings his keen analysis and insider perspective to the long and ongoing clash between the United States and Iran, beginning with the fall of the shah and the seizure of the American embassy in Tehran in 1979. Pollack examines all the major events in U.S.-Iran relations–including the hostage crisis, the U.S. tilt toward Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, the Iran-Contra scandal, American-Iranian military tensions in 1987 and 1988, the covert Iranian war against U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf that culminated in the 1996 Khobar Towers terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia, and recent U.S.-Iran skirmishes over Afghanistan and Iraq. He explains the strategies and motives from American and Iranian perspectives and tells how each crisis colored the thinking of both countries’ leadership as they shaped and reshaped their policies over time. Pollack also describes efforts by moderates of various stripes to try to find some way past animosities to create a new dynamic in Iranian-American relations, only to find that when one side was ready for such a step, the other side fell short. With balanced tone and insight, Pollack explains how the United States and Iran reached this impasse; why this relationship is critical to regional, global, and U.S. interests; and what basic political choices are available as we deal with this important but deeply troubled country.",['Kenneth Pollack'],Random House,['Political Science']

Fifty years after its original publication, Catch-22 remains a cornerstone of American literature and one of the funniest—and most celebrated—books of all time. In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer. Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved. This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more.

Run Strong,5.0,Read the chapters - pick and choose what you think is important,"This is not a traditional training book like Daniels or Coe and Martin, nor is it one of the scores of ""Explain Everything About Running to the Beginner"" books out there. Instead, it focuses on the aspects of training with which even experienced runners may be unfamiliar. For example, it discusses lifting weights, stretching, dietary concerns, etc. in addition to topics directly related to running such as peaking for a race, improving leg speed, addressing long-term aerobic development, multi-pace training, etc.This is a valuable book because even if you know a lot about running, you will probably find something new in here. Keep in mind what many of the authors say must be taken with a grain of salt. The jury is still out on whether lower-body exercises and form drills will make you a better distance runner, for example. If you tried to do all the supplementary training discussed in this book, you would probably be working out three hours a day at least. You'll have to try different things and decide for yourself if they are helping your running or just wasting your time and energy. But hey, if you're like most serious runners, you're willing to try almost anything if it will keep you healthy and make you faster. So check the book out for yourself.","Step into my office if you want to run faster, stronger, and pain-free.

THE CATCHER IN THE RYE,5.0,Catcher in the Rye,"Book arrived on time and in the condition specified by the seller, would definitely buy more books from this dealer.","Anyone who has read J. D. Salinger's New Yorker stories - particularly A Perfect Day for Bananafish, Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut, The Laughing Man, and For Esme - With Love and Squalor, will not be surprised by the fact that his first novel is full of children. The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep.",['J.D. Salinger'],"Little, Brown",['Fiction']
One Night for Love,4.0,Good Read,"I liked the book though a bit too descriptive. I would like to see a follow-up with Lauren, I found her to be the more likeable character. Hopefully this author will be writing it in the near future, I will keep a check on her book listings. Lauren was a complicated character who was extremely suppressed emotionally and the book, if written, would be a good one.","One reckless man . . . One passionate woman. Enter the world of Mary Balogh—the glittering ballrooms and vast country estates of Regency-era England, where romance, with all its mystery, magic, and surprises, comes vibrantly alive. It was a perfect morning in May . . . Neville Wyatt, Earl of Kilbourne, awaited his bride at the altar—when a ragged beggar woman raced down the aisle instead. The cream of the ton saw him stare, shocked, then declare that this was his wife! One night of passion was all he remembered as he beheld Lily, the woman he'd wed, loved, and lost on the battlefield in Portugal. Now he said he'd honor his commitment to her—regardless of the gulf that lay between them. Then Lily spoke her mind . . . She said she wanted only to start a new life—wanted only a husband who truly loved her. She had to leave him to learn how to meet his world on her terms. So Lily agreed to earn her keep as his aunt's companion and study the genteel arts. Soon she was the toast of the ton, every inch a countess fit for the earl, who vowed to prove to his remarkable wife that what he felt for her was far more than desire, that what he wanted from her was much more than . . . One Night for Love.",['Mary Balogh'],Dell,['Fiction']
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,5.0,Good Book,I really liked this book very much. I never have had my mind go so crazy before. It was like having a movie play in your head and it was great. I would recomend this to anyone who loves to read Mark Twain!,"When Connecticut mechanic and foreman Hank Morgan is knocked unconscious, he wakes not to the familiar scenes of nineteenth-century America but to the bewildering sights and sounds of sixth-century Camelot. Although confused at first and quickly imprisoned, he soon realises that his knowledge of the future can transform his fate. Correctly predicting a solar eclipse from inside his prison cell, Morgan terrifies the people of England into releasing him and swiftly establishes himself as the most powerful magician in the land, stronger than Merlin and greatly admired by Arthur himself. But the Connecticut Yankee wishes for more than simply a place at the Round Table. Soon, he begins a far greater struggle: to bring American democratic ideals to Old England. Complex and fascinating, A Connecticut Yankee is a darkly comic consideration of the nature of human nature and society.

Talismans of Shannara,5.0,"So good, you have to buy the other 6!","I loved this book. The whole story comes to one final end, after 3 books full of running, screaming, and fighting. To date, I haven't had the chance to read The Sword of Shannara or it's sequels; I started with the scions of Shannara, Book 1 of the Heritage of Shannara. The story of the Ohmsfords and Leahs is like a history class to me. But that makes it more exciting, because it puts you more in the place of Par, Coll, and Morgan. All three have magic, created several hundred years ago, and eventually given to them, which they use to defeat the Shadowen. I love that. The whole book is almost like an AD&amp;D adventure; some have magic, some have brute strength, and some have nothing but their wits and a dagger. It makes it really exciting, because the battles and the characters are described excellently. It's so possible to imagine Walker facing off against the four Horsemen, or Coll chasing Par through the wilderness. I love this book, and it's predecessors! I can't wait to get my hands on Sword of Shannara!","The fourth volume of The Heritage of Shannara, which continues one of the most popular fantasy series of all time. The Shadowen still swarm over the Four Lands, poisoning everything with their dark magic. And their leader is determined to destroy all the Scions of Shannara. For Walker Boh, he dispatches the Four Horsemen. For Wren, he sends an untrue friend. And for Par, he devises the most terrible fate of all. With these traps cleverly laid, the charges given by the shade of the Druid Allanon are doomed to failure—unless Par can discover a way to harness the power of the Sword of Shannara. Thus continues the enthralling Shannara epic, a spellbinding tale of adventure, magic, and myth… BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Terry Brooks's The Measure of the Magic.",['Terry Brooks'],Del Rey,['Fiction']
The Hobbit,2.0,Very Disapointing Packaging,"I've heard the broadcast before and know it's a great show, but this release of it contains ""green"" packaging. In other words, cheap cardboard-sandwiched discs of which I personally guarantee that each one will come with more scratches than the behind of a dwarf in a sand-laden speedo. Again - not green as in soft green grass, but green as in the greenbacks the company makes from this type of cut in quality.If a company had pride in its product it would have at least foregone the post consumer content grade recycled paperboard and upgrade to paper sleeves. Or better yet, perhaps a $3 jewel case that holds all 5 discs? The exterior box is certainly large enough for a nice plastic jewel case. Instead it contains a cheap, thin, cardboard book of the discs that takes up all of 1/3 of the interior space. The rest of the box is loaded with a large cardboard insert as filler.These type of (goblin) antics are why people stop buying audio CDs and look for other means to acquire their audio (preferably without the aid of a burglar). I certainly won't buy any more products from AudioGO or BBC Audiobooks without holding the product first. The NPR wood box set of the Hobbit radio drama at least shows some class... and (not an official review) from when I last held the wood box set, I could say that the discs were protected enough that not even scratches from Smaug would be of concern.","Celebrating 75 years of one of the world's most treasured classics with an all new trade paperback edition.

The Supreme Court (Your Government: How It Works),1.0,Filled with factual errors ....,"It amazed me, as a casual student of American History, to find so many factual errors in this short children's book dealing with the US Supreme Court. It refers to Justices Wendell and Blackmun as Chief Justices of the Supreme Court when in fact they were Associate Justices. Although the book was published in 2000, it says that the Constitution has had only had 26 amendments, even though the 27th amendment was ratified in 1992.What's more, the book tells you very little about the actual workings of the court. It deals broadly with the court's historical importance which I personally found misleading since the title is &quot;Your Government: How it Works: The US Supreme Court&quot;.Arthur M. Schlesinger's name is shown on the cover as &quot;Consulting Editor&quot;. My best guess is that any consulting Mr. Schlesinger did on this one was strictly from a distance.","Classic Books Library presents this brand new edition of “The Federalist Papers”, a collection of separate essays and articles compiled in 1788 by Alexander Hamilton. Following the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776, the governing doctrines and policies of the States lacked cohesion. “The Federalist”, as it was previously known, was constructed by American statesman Alexander Hamilton, and was intended to catalyse the ratification of the United States Constitution. Hamilton recruited fellow statesmen James Madison Jr., and John Jay to write papers for the compendium, and the three are known as some of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Alexander Hamilton (c. 1755–1804) was an American lawyer, journalist and highly influential government official. He also served as a Senior Officer in the Army between 1799-1800 and founded the Federalist Party, the system that governed the nation’s finances. His contributions to the Constitution and leadership made a significant and lasting impact on the early development of the nation of the United States.","['Alexander Hamilton', 'John Jay', 'James Madison']",Read Books Ltd,['History']
Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty,3.0,Killing Killers,"""Ultimate Punishment"" was written soon after Scott Turow finished serving on a public commission to investigate the administration of the death penalty in Illinois. The book is part memoire, part reflection on capital punishment. It's rational and fairminded, but very short (barely 120 pages)and very light on legal analysis or social science.Its core rhetorical strategy is to consider a few actual death penalty cases that plunge the reader into the pain and moral ambiguities of capital punishment. On the one hand, these horrific crimes cry out for vengeance. It's difficult to imagine a 10-year old girl being raped, tortured and strangled without wanting to string up the perpetrator. And yet...there's no evidence that the death penalty deters murder. The killers themselves are badly broken beings, victims of child abuse or mental retardation. Innocent men are sometimes sentenced to death: when a grisly crime is committed, juries are eager to convict someone (anyone), and some cops and prosecutors are willing to cut corners. And the whole death penalty system is arbitrary and biased against non-whites: the evidence shows that juries value the lives of white victims more than the lives of non-white victims. It's a wretched human landscape.Unfortunately, Turow's potted case summaries are too rushed and underanalyzed to really do justice to the subject. The book feels like a long magazine article. In the end, he decided that he is against the death penalty. That's an understandable position but it was no excuse for not writing a longer, more serious book.Memory Lane: I worked briefly as a deputy district attorney in California in the mid-1980s after I graduated from law school. Every ambitious young deputy aspired to put a ""bad guy"" in the gas chamber someday -- this was the ultimate box to check in a prosecutorial career. We rookies were encouraged to observe an ongoing capital case. The lead prosecutor was an ex-Marine and Vietnam vet, an uptight, creepy guy who tried to impress women by telling stories about killing Viet Cong. The details of the crime were revolting -- the defendant, a security guard, had bludgeoned a young woman to death and then violated her corpse. Until then I had been moderately pro-death penalty. But sitting in the courtoom only a few feet from the defendant, it was inconceivable to me that he should be put to death, no matter what he had done. His life seemed sacred. I was happy to quit that job.","America's leading writer about the law takes a close, incisive look at one of society's most vexing legal issues Scott Turow is known to millions as the author of peerless novels about the troubling regions of experience where law and reality intersect. In ""real life,"" as a respected criminal lawyer, he has been involved with the death penalty for more than a decade, including successfully representing two different men convicted in death-penalty prosecutions. In this vivid account of how his views on the death penalty have evolved, Turow describes his own experiences with capital punishment from his days as an impassioned young prosecutor to his recent service on the Illinois commission which investigated the administration of the death penalty and influenced Governor George Ryan's unprecedented commutation of the sentences of 164 death row inmates on his last day in office. Along the way, he provides a brief history of America's ambivalent relationship with the ultimate punishment, analyzes the potent reasons for and against it, including the role of the victims' survivors, and tells the powerful stories behind the statistics, as he moves from the Governor's Mansion to Illinois' state-of-the art 'super-max' prison and the execution chamber. Ultimate Punishment, this gripping, clear-sighted, necessary examination of the principles, the personalities, and the politics of a fundamental dilemma of our democracy has all the drama and intellectual substance of Turow's celebrated fiction.",['Scott Turow'],"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",['Social Science']
Alfred Hitchcock Presents 12 Stories For Late Night,1.0,"Dreary, boring, a series of nothings","I kept thinking something was going to happen. I thought, ""This book can't go all the way to the end without anything happening, can it?"" But it did. It was quite a feat. You could summarize this book in about 45 seconds. And you'd likely want your 45 seconds back. Is this supposed to be 1984, Brave New World, or even Hunger Games? If you compare it to any of those books, it is utter fail. I guess it was supposed to be sad, but I didn't even care about anyone, or anything in the story. And there was this weird section at the end, where they try to pretend it was a true story, and they are having a meeting to discuss the historical facts about the book. It starts out talking about a planned luncheon of the historical group. Was that supposed to make it seem ""authentic?"" It was just bizarre.",,['Alfred Hitchcock'],,['Detective and mystery stories']

Parenting from the heart,5.0,I have used this book in Parenting Classes for two years,"This book will not only change your relationship with your children but also with your spouse, relatives and co workers. It's not a how to book so much as a new way of being. Learning to listen to the wisdom that we all have within brings us to a new level of consciousness and understanding. I have had great success using this book in two years of parenting classes, I would use no other. The results are long lasting.","Just when you thought you've heard it all-""Parenting from the Heart"" offers a new and different, refreshing approach to parenting. This easy-to-understand, down-to-earth book moves beyond parenting theories and techniques to get to the heart of parenting. If parents know how to look within their hearts to find the answers they need, parenting techniques are not necessary. If parents know how to find a loving connection with their children at most times, discipline and consequences are rarely necessary. All parents have it within them to bring out the best in their children. Approaching parents in this way makes parenting a true pleasure instead of the battle and chore it often becomes. Many so-called experts say that raising kids is the toughest job any of us will ever do, but it does not have to be that way. It can be the most joyful thing any of us will ever do.

"The Hobbitt, or there and back again; illustrated by the author.",5.0,The one that started it all... Yes its a bit 'kiddy',"Perhaps THE BEST little adventure story every written. Written for kids but certainly enjoyed by all. It has trolls, dragons, a kindly but strange wizard, dwarves, and of course Hobbits. It's really a story of bravery and strong friendships in the face of mishaps and evil things. What stands out in this book and The Lord of the Rings is that the world Tolkien creates sucks you in hopelessly. It only takes a few sentances and you really feel like you are along for the journey.Tolkien creates a world with a huge history full of peoples and monsters and dwarves, with nature playing a large role in all of his books. The history part is small in The Hobbit since its focused on the journey and characters. The Hobbit is meant to be a lead-in to The Lord of the Rings, which has much more history and nature and more characters than the Hobbit. 'Rings is a darker tale and much more serious. Its harder to read, much longer, and I think the best adventure story ever written.In response to Chris Fletcher, you have some valid criticisms of Tolkien. His writing style is a bit, well, sticky. When you think things should be moving faster and faster and the action is coming, you instead get ""and then the big troll (or whatever) was killed. On to the next adventure.""However, the upside to this is you really feel like you are reading a kind of history book found in Middle Earth. I think Tolkien was a bit nuts and that's why his stuff was so good. He half-believed he really was writing and living in the world of his own making. He created entire languages, maps, unforgetable characters and mostly sad but gripping tales of adventure. Some people can't get through Tolkien's sticky prose when reading the lengthy The Lord of the Rings and I understand why, but stick with it! After reading the whole thing you will be glad you did. Remember no one can tell you how to read a book. If you come accross a paragraph about Bilbo's half-sister and all her family and the history of her cat, just skip it if you want. Tolkien really does go out on a limb sometimes escpecially with all the names and family trees and fictional history.However, this same strange Tolkien style allows for re-reading and getting much more information, and a sense of depth and life to Middle Earth that is truely amazing. I have read the series, both the Hobbit and LOTR twice and I got much more the second time through. I read it slower and tried to keep the characters and places in my head. You can buy a nice map book which lays out all of tolkiens worlds in detail including battles and paths that the characters follow. Its by Karen Wynn Fonstad and has a lot of detail. Careful though, some plot happenings are given away in the tracking of characters and the battle maps :DIf you really want to get background info you have to start with the Silmarillion. And that beast can drive you crazy. Parts of it are amazing to read however and it explains some of the history that was confusing in LOTR. Where did Galadriel come from? What or who exactly is Gandalf? What's a wizard? What are the counterparts to Sauron and other evil in middle earth? Surely there must be some good gods or angel like beings? So, Silmarillion: very difficult, for tolkein fans mostly. Its long, hundreds of names, not a continuous story. It does explain a great deal about the gods and formation of Middle Earth and many things and people and places that show up later in the Hobbit and LOTR.Hobbit: very easy fun read, not a whole lot of depth, short, great characters, great adventure.The Lord of the Rings: medium difficulty, lots of depth, some history, lots of names, some difficult and confusing paragraphs, but a truely great tale. The kind of book where you find yourself kinda stunned after reading the last sentance. (The movie is not bad, but messed things up a bit, read the book! Notice that Tolkien's name is not on the movie. The family took their name off it because of the Hollywood treatment.)","Bilbo Baggins, a respectable, well-to-do hobbit, lives comfortably in his hobbit-hole until the day the wandering wizard Gandalf chooses him to take part in an adventure from which he may never return.",['J.

Dancing with Vengeance: A Woman Reborn,4.0,Seriously Superior Romance Novel,"In &quot;Dancing With Vengeance&quot; Ms. Newcomer writes a romance novel that is at least 2 cuts above the norm in the genre. Her writing is well thought out. Her use of metaphor and simile is fairly rich and delicious. And her character development is superior.It was indeed refreshing to read Ms. Newcomer's book, as she uses a vocabulary that is significantly more prolific than the average Romance Novelist. Her book, based on historical realities, is not just a romance novel, but in addition, a work of historical fiction. She deals quite extensively with Atilla the Hun, and the time period 450 to 500 AD or so.But at the heart of the novel, is the exposure of the most intimate and private thoughts of her protagonist. Ms. Newcomer takes her reader into the mind of a lady with great knowledge and sophistication, in a very barbaric world. The character allows us to see this barbarism, and understand how she was able to come to terms with it, in her own way, which is certainly unique.The book is a real page turning novel and will provide several good hours of entertainment. It is suggested for anyone who is interested in the romance novel genre, and to anyone interested in the time period and subject she covers.","Between humans and the Magic Kingdom there are invisible connections for almost all beings.

The character development is top notch and the book is a very quick read. Tolkien's ingenuity in creating a time and place is surpassed by none. The one odd thing I noticed is that it appears that the Lord of the Rings was written for a more mature audience than the Hobbit.

"Sea of Glory: America's Voyage of Discovery: The U.S. Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842",2.0,Soap Opera around the Globe,"This book deals with an interesting, little known episode in the American history of science and exploration: the U.S. Exploring Expedition (Ex. Ex.), but the narrative of this volume is badly flawed and woefully incomplete. Unfortunately, it is biased toward the daily interactions among the protagonists of the Ex. Ex. The author spends perhaps more than 50% of the book talking about the hideous behavior of Charles Wilkes--in charge of the expedition--and focuses on the daily conflicts and outrageous interactions between him and his officers. A few selected paragraphs would have sufficed to adequately cover this aspect, but no!... Mr. Philbrick has to flog this dead horse over and over, until there is nothing left to say about how overbearing or despicable Charles Wilkes was.At the end of the book, Philbrick still spends a 30-page long chapter providing all kinds of irrelevant, picky details about the acrimonious court martial which took place after the Ex. Ex. had ended; nothing useful or even remotely interesting is learnt from this gratuitous and unbelievably boring chapter. Instead, Philbrick could have devoted more pages actually telling the readers about the interesting exploratory aspects of the expedition. For example, Philbrick does not even mention the visit of the Ex. Ex. to Maui, or the fact that several of its members descended and explored Haleakala's vast crater for the first time, describing in the process several of its unusual volcanic features. Obviously, devoting any space to this and other fascinating excursions would have cut into Philbrick's long-winded narrative about the constant bickering among Ex. Ex. participants.In this book, supposedly about the unusually important scientific aspects of the Exploring Expedition, one gets the overwhelming impression Philbrick really has little interest in the geographical explorations and scientific accomplishments of this extraordinary first American circumnavigation trip. Instead, he reduces what should have been an exciting account of an extraordinary voyage into a trite story about the pettiness of Wilkes and the other characters of the Ex. Ex. By doing so, Philbrick does the ultimate disservice to the Ex. Ex.; he simply ignores its most serious scientific aspects, and chooses to focus instead on its jejune, soap-opera details.I have read extensive sections of the original 4-volume narrative by Wilkes (1845), and can say it is considerably more interesting than this modern but misguided account.","""A treasure of a book.""—David McCullough The harrowing story of a pathbreaking naval expedition that set out to map the entire Pacific Ocean, dwarfing Lewis and Clark with its discoveries, from the New York Times bestselling author of Valiant Ambition and In the Hurricane's Eye. A New York Times Notable Book America's first frontier was not the West; it was the sea, and no one writes more eloquently about that watery wilderness than Nathaniel Philbrick. In his bestselling In the Heart of the Sea Philbrick probed the nightmarish dangers of the vast Pacific. Now, in an epic sea adventure, he writes about one of the most ambitious voyages of discovery the Western world has ever seen—the U.S. Exploring Expedition of 1838–1842. On a scale that dwarfed the journey of Lewis and Clark, six magnificent sailing vessels and a crew of hundreds set out to map the entire Pacific Ocean and ended up naming the newly discovered continent of Antarctica, collecting what would become the basis of the Smithsonian Institution. Combining spellbinding human drama and meticulous research, Philbrick reconstructs the dark saga of the voyage to show why, instead of being celebrated and revered as that of Lewis and Clark, it has—until now—been relegated to a footnote in the national memory.

Energy pricing in the Soviet Union (IMF working paper),3.0,More 60's nostalgia...,"Although &quot;Flowers in the Dustbin: the Rise of Rock and Roll 1947-1977&quot; uses a quote from the Sex Pistols for it's title, that seems to be the only credit given to the bands of the 70's. This book is yet another aging-boomer nostalgia trip for &quot;when music really mattered&quot; &amp; seems to think anything released post-Woodstock is worthless.The author, James Miller, was also responsible for the original edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll&quot; as well as the recently televised &quot;History of Rock&quot;. His viewpoints haven't noticibly changed or expanded since his previous critical forays.Yes, we know how vital the early rock pioneers like Little Richard were. Yes, I'm sure the 60's seemed very earth-shaking &amp; cosmic in their implications for those who claim to remember them. But for those of us who discovered rock when Ziggy &amp; T.Rex exploded out of the denim-clad, stoned ranks of ...musicians, short shrift is given (as usual) to the cultural significance of glitter &amp; punk.Let's be honest here: in the overall scheme of modern media Iggy, Bowie, the Pistols, even the Monkees have all had a heck of a lot more resonance than any of Miller's psychedelic favorites. Really, how can you take a &quot;cultural history&quot; seriously when it gives many more pages to Elvis' death than it does to Led Zeppelin? It's not even illustrated with photos, which is a great loss considering the visual aspect of rock.If you're not pining with nostalgia for the 60's, skip this book. You've probably read or heard it all before anyway.","A decade into the transition, many of the successor states of the former Soviet Union (FSU) continue to use energy sector quasi-fiscal activities (QFAs), especially low energy prices and the toleration of payment arrears, to provide large implicit and untargeted subsidies. These activities disguise the overall size of the government, cause overconsumption and waste, and contribute to macroeconomic imbalances. This paper analyses such activities in FSU countries, with particular emphasis on two case studies (Azerbaijan and Ukraine). The paper's policy conclusions point to the need to increase energy prices, combined with a strengthening of safety nets to protect the poor, better enforcement of payment discipline, and more efforts to achieve fiscal transparency.","['Martin Petri', 'Günther Taube', 'Aleh Tsyvinski']",International Monetary Fund,['Business & Economics']

Together is All We Need (Shenandoah Sisters #4),4.0,New Difficulties Emerge,"The Shenandoah Sisters Series continues with TOGETHER IS ALL WE NEED. In this collection of books two young girls, Katie and Mayme, have found themselves alone and left to run Katie's family plantation. Along the way, the two forge an unlikely friendship that transcends racial lines and defies the social mores of the time. The story opens when a new uncle, Burchard Clairborne, comes to town. Uncle Burchard is Katie's father's brother, and he feels he is next in line to inherit the family plantation. Initially, Katie and Mayme continue their attempts to maintain the secret they share, the fact that they live alone. But Uncle Burchard's persistence and overall lack of sensitivity, eventually leads to the uncovering of the very thing they have worked so hard to hide. He begins an aggressive mission to take over the plantation and make it profitable for him and along the way he decides that everyone living there with the exception of his niece must find a new home. The girls become the talk of the town and experience first hand the disdain of the neighbors for both their deception and their unconventional inter-racial friendship. Things look bleak until yet another uncle, Ward Daniels, appears with some shocking news, just in the nick of time. From there, the unlikely ""family"" works to reunite with Katie's Uncle Templeton and build a new life together.TOGETHER IS ALL WE NEED continues to meet expectations for fans of the Shenandoah Girls Series. There is drama, controversy, and difficulties but ultimately the love shared among the primary characters helps them survive. Michael Phillips does a great job capturing the spirit of the time period by providing well rounded characters that are much more complex than the archetypal post-civil war personas quite often presented in literature. In this book the characters, particularly the former slaves, overtly struggle to reconcile their previous notions of their societal role with the racial equality they share on this ""color blind"" plantation. The dynamic characters, subtle spiritual messages and well-paced plot make this a fulfilling and enjoyable page turner.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers","Shenandoah Sisters Book 4, the sequel to The Color of Your Skin Ain't the Color of Your Heart.

Hiroshima (A Borzoi book),3.0,"It has the potential for greatness, but falls short.","While achieving acclaim for his novel Hiroshima, I feel that John Hersey's work is overrated and does not meet the publicity it has received.

His non-preaching point of view proved critical to the universal feeling which emanates form this novel. It is said to have reached individuals across the globe with famous persons like Albert Einstein ordering one thousand copies. I do not dispute this, but I feel that in his effort to be non-biased, he loses many readers to a lack of interest. This novel is presented in a manner that quickly becomes mundane and boring. Certain ideas and events show up over and over again in slightly differing circumstances. Also, the story, while pristine in preciseness, is extremely confusing. Two of the six main characters share the same last name and as the novel progresses, an additional two hibakusha change their names. I felt bewildered while reading. I found myself having to go back and re-read passages, sometimes pages. This novel just could NOT keep my attention. Hiroshima has the potential to be a truly touching book.

"Oresteia: Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, The Eumenides",5.0,A Civic Masterpiece,"Aeschylus is claimed to have written approximately 70 plays. Of these, only seven survive. Among the survivors is this trilogy, based on the myth of the House of Atreus, and it is a masterpiece. Most readers today probably read only the first and most famous play, Agamemnon. This is a mistake because Agamemnon, a great play in isolation, is even more impressive when viewed in the context of the trilogy as a whole. Much has been made of the nature of these plays as psychological family dramas, and this is correct but limiting. Reading the whole series of plays reveals Aeschylus' intention to depict an important social phenomenon, the replacement of traditional Greek religion and aristocratic society by the more humanistic ethos of the Athenian polis. The trilogy begins with the working out of the inherited curse of the House of Atreus and its bloody consequences, and concludes with the incorporation of the embodiment of passion and traditional religion, the Furies, into the state of Athens. Aeschylus contrasts the aristocratic ideals of revenge, unfettered passion, and primitive religion with the idea of human justice, the polis, and the more rationalistic worship of Apollo, Athena, and the Olympian Gods. This is a superb adaptation of myth to a theme of the greatest interest to his audience, the citizens of democratic Athens.

Wuthering Heights,2.0,An Honest Opinion...,"Wuthering Heights is a very slow book. Not much happens and you shouldn't read it if you want an interesting story. After reading it, I feel that the book could have been shortened greatly. Even though there are some excellent themes in it, I don't see WH as an example of fine literature. Authors such as Hemingway (For Whom the Bell Tolls), Dumas (The Count of Monte Cristo--Unabridged), and Frank (Alas Babylon) spin much better tales with much stronger themes and meaning. My advice: skip this book and read the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo.","Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. HeathcliffÕs dwelling. ÔWutheringÕ being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones. Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date Ô1500,Õ and the name ÔHareton Earnshaw.Õ I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium. One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory lobby or passage: they call it here Ôthe houseÕ pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.",['Emily Bronte'],Library of Alexandria,

"Lesser Evil (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Mission Gamma, Book 4)",2.0,Why in such a durned HURRY?,"The first three books in this series were superb, especially Book Two, MISSION GAMMA: THIS GRAY SPIRIT, by writing neophyte Heather Jarman (more! more!). Book Four seemed to have been written on the back of old scratch pads on a commuter train, as if the author couldn't wait to end it. The story moves along, but moves far too fast. There was little character development, and what little there was tended to be sketchily drawn or reflect negatively on characters like Vaughn.And God forbid, they brought the Borg back in to assimilate what might otherwise have been a good novel. Haven't they learned? The Borg were the most snoring-boring of all Star Trek villains, among whom only Hugh on TNG and those semi-Borgs on VOYAGER remain somewhat interesting. I couldn't stand &quot;Seven of Nine&quot; and never again watched Voyager after Kes departed. The &quot;Borg Queen&quot; in the Star Trek movie FIRST CONTACT was downright embarrassing, the concept unworthy of intelligent life. As for Picard as a temporary Borg, give me TNG's THE INNER LIGHT any old time. The only good thing ever to result from the Borg was actress Alfre Woodard's comment in FIRST CONTACT: &quot;Borg? Sounds Swedish.&quot; It cracked up the theater audience, including me.Unfortunately there's nothing as impressive as that quip in this novel.

The Pop-Up Book of Nightmares,4.0,"Darker then ""Phobias;"" Superb Pop-Up Engineering","This book follows up the superb collaborative work seen in the Pop Up Book of Phobias. I found that the illustrations in this book affected me more because I have actually had many of these nightmares. The images in the book are darker and potentially more disturbing.The superb paper engineering is quite complex. Richly colored illustrations rise out of the pages in complex moving patterns. The scenes actually change sequentially as you move the pages back and forth.I suspect that most of us have had several of these nightmares at one time or another. Almost anyone can find something in these nightmares that would strike a responsive chord.That said, I felt that the text detracted from the artwork. The text is a parody of ""Freudian"" dream interpretation. In truth, this would not be the way that Freud would have interpreted these types of dreams.

Great Expectations,4.0,While a very good book I Expected it to be better,"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; seems to be a term used to describe a young man with expectations of becoming a Gentleman. This is the story about a young boy named Pip who though considered poor, was raised as an apprentice in a respectable trade. When his parents died when he was very young he was brought up by his older sister and her husband Joe Gargery the blacksmith. Joe although a little slow, acts in many ways as a loving father and friend to the boy, and is more noble than any of the other characters in the whole book. His older sister however isn't as nice, and in the modern day world probably would have been brought up on charges of child abuse. (If this book was ever remade into a modern day movie I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see playing Pip's older sister than Kathy Bates. I pictured her every time the character is mentioned.)Pip then comes into some money by a mysterious benefactor, and becomes an ungrateful little boy who looks down upon those he used to associate with and puts on airs. At this point, in my opinion Pip becomes a very unlikable character for most of the remainder of the book. He believes Miss Havisham who is a mysterious mean old wealthy lady is his benefactor and falls in love with her adopted daughter Estella. I believe this makes Pip look very shallow, since the only redeeming quality she seems to possess is her looks.Pip moves to London and is entrusted to a lawyer named Jenkins and his assistant Wemmick to teach him how to become a gentleman. The lawyer Jenkins, while unloving, is likeable, and in his own way noble. Wemmick who leads a double life is one of the best characters in the book. (I believe there are many people who would like to keep their work life separate from the home life, and can relate to this character.)Jenkins hires a tutor for Pip to teach him how to act like a gentleman. It seems that all the gentleman in this story do however is spend money. Pip and the tutor's son Herbert who becomes Pip's best friend then proceed to work themselves into debt.A pirate which Pip met in his childhood comes back into this life, and brings many changes. (The pirate Pip meets reminded me of the sea captain from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, or the main character in the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.)In the end Pip tries to redeem himself, and in some ways does.There are some plot twists and mysteries to solve. Some work out well and are pleasant surprises, others just seem unnecessary to the story.","Penguin Classics e-books give you the best possible editions of Charles Dickens's novels, including all the original illustrations, useful and informative introductions, the definitive, accurate text as it was meant to be published, a chronology of Dickens's life and notes that fill in the background to the book.

The Outsiders,5.0,Probably the greatest book ever written about kids.,"This is the best book i have ever read. It relates very well to teenagers of all generations. Many problems are discussed. Ponyboy versus socs, Pony versus himself, Pony versus his brother Dairy. Everybody should read this book, it is the best book i have ever read.","Celebrate the 50th anniversary (April, 2017) of a landmark coming-of-age American novel with a Penguin Classics edition featuring an introduction by Jodi Picoult, author of My Sister's Keeper. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read First published in 1967, S. E. Hinton's novel was an immediate phenomenon. Today, with more than eight million copies sold, The Outsiders continues to resonate with its powerful portrait of the bonds and boundaries of friendship. In Ponyboy's world there are two types of people. There are the Socs, the rich society kids who get away with anything. Then there are the greasers, like Ponyboy, who aren't so lucky. Ponyboy has a few things he can count on: his older brothers, his friends, and trouble with the Socs, whose idea of a good time is beating up greasers. At least he knows what to expect-until the night things go too far. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Children of the lens (The Lensman series),5.0,"""It was indescribility cubed""","Readers who have been following this series all along might note that whenever Smith is unable to properly describe something, instead of coming up with new ways to describe it, he falls back on the trick of just saying that it is impossible to describe and the regular mind cannot conceive of the visual scope of what is happening on the page. For some reason, and don't ask me why, this becomes part of the charm of the series. In a world where we're given more and more special effects, with armies of computers doing their best everyday to make every possible image come to life, it's kind of nice for someone to go ""Here, I'm not going to help you. Use your imagination.""So, with that, here we are. The end. The culmination. With the previous book almost having taken us as far as the series could go, this one goes and brings it the rest of the way home. The first book detailed the conflict between the Arisians and the Eddorians, with humanity caught in the middle and the Lensmen designed as the people who would eventually allow civilization to be saved. Here we find the people who are behind the dread menace of Boskone and the ultimate destiny for the galaxy and the universe at large. Heady stuff, indeed.As the title helpfully explains, this adventure does not involve hero Kimball Kinnison so much as his kids, all five of them. Each one is advanced in their own way and with some training from the Arisians, they'll turn out to be just what the galaxy needs to take down the evildoers who have been plaguing us nonstop for five adventures now.Amazingly, the kids aren't annoying. While they are precocious, that's clear from the start and they don't have the sassy, know-it-all quality that a lot of smart SF kids have. They're confident and seem to know what they're doing but also have a good amount of doubts and actually seem to act like a family, which gives the story a nice generational feel. With dad still effective and mom no slouch herself, our heroes aren't so much sidelined as doing their best as the new generation takes over. They learn as they go and watching that process is just as much fun as seeing Kim go through it several books ago.Indeed, the novel makes sure to give him time as well, and one of the amazing things about this novel is that it doesn't seem crowded even though the cast is literally packed. You've got the five kids and their parents, plus the other Second Stage Lensmen, all characters in their own right (the bloke from Rigel, Worsel and Nadreck, who will come up with an exact mathematical equation on how to murder you) and while everyone should be jockeying for space, Smith manages to keep up the frenetic pace and yet give everyone some space to breathe. Kim even has time to don new identities and write a terrible science-fiction story.It's the climax that makes this all work. As the finale of a six book series spanning galaxies and decades (more than that, if you consider when the conflict between Arisia and Eddore started), it needs to be epic and Smith does not disappoint, dragging out every trick that served him well in the previous stories and upping the ante considerably, so that while the outcome is never in doubt, when the triumph does come, it feels utterly earned. Considering that the whole Eddore/Arisia thing wasn't even part of the original concept (by the time the series was in full swing it was but parts of ""Triplanetary"" were written to sort of retroactively incorporate the idea) he manages to bring it all to a satisfying conclusion, taking the fight to Eddore itself (as it eventually had to be) and achieving the feat of turning five characters who we've only known for three hundred pages into old friends, so that when they enter into their final evolution, it feels like an ending, or at least as far as we can travel with the story. More will happen, we just won't need to see it. The time belongs to others, and we can retire with Kinnison and Clarissa, content that peace and goodwill have been preserved.It's not for nothing that this series has been voted one of the greatest space operas of all time. In terms of sheer scope and characters it remains one of the most fun experiences that one can have, with careening planets and stalwart clever heroes and base evil that can sink to the darkest depths (or at least as far as the 1940s could conceive), a battle that feels like a struggle for the survival of civilization itself. Is it old-fashioned and a tad hokey in parts? Sure, but what wouldn't feel that way from this point in time. The final determination is if the story holds up and in that sense it can stand alongside any modern day space epic, in terms of sheer verve and pluck and invention. There's a definite arc and when you're finished, an even more definite sense that a journey has been completed. The epilogue leaves room for more adventures but we don't need a sequel. Out of breath and with senses overwhelmed, we can stop here and rest, finally.","""Children of the Lens"" by Edward Elmer Smith. Published by Good Press.

Power of Impossible Thinking,5.0,Required reading before attempting any change,"This book should be required as the companion to every other business and self improvement book sold. I have read that over 75% of organizational change efforts fail, and this book explains how to overcome this problem. Most change programs (personal or professional, organizational or individual) fail because they don&#8217;t address the mental models that people use to comprehend and act in the world. Wind, Crook, and Gunther explain how not only to understand how mental models work but also how to change them. The writing is very direct and easy to read with excellent examples and insights. The ideas are based on solid research and science yet practical and usable. This is the first book from the new Wharton School Publishing imprint of Pearson Education, and if this is a sign of things to come, this will be an influential publisher of business books.","50,000 copies sold, now in paperback...

Sous Vide and Cook-Chill Processing for the Food Industry (Chapman & Hall Food Science Book),5.0,The Science of Sous Vide Cooking,"The Sous Vide method of cooking is the current craze among high end chefs. As someone who keeps up with this trend, I am always amazed by how little of the basic food science is understood by Sous Vides many proponents. Botulism is a real concern when cooking in an anaerobic environment. Understanding the time and temperature continuum is essential for producing safe food.Sue Ghazala's text is the only book available that really discusses these important concerns. The book was written by and for food scientists. Nevertheless, a lay person who is willing to spend the time can with some effort follow the basic arguments. Again, this is a science text and if you are looking for receipes or how to instructions, you need to look somewhere else.I believe it is just a question of time before a well meaning chef accidentily ends up killing or seriously injuring his or her clientele. The reason this has not happened yet is that in raw numbers, very little Sous Vide cuisine is being produced in Europe and North America. This book is a must purchase for anyone who is thinking about scaling up their Sous Vide production to a commercial scale. Highly recommended.","This book provides a comprehensive and innovative overview of new and emerging sous vide and cook-chill techniques that are, or soon to be, commercially used for the food industry. Written by a range of international experts, the book integrates all subjects relative to sous vide and cook-chill processing, allowing food industry personnel to assimilate quickly the essential principles behind each technique and their applications. It is an essential reference for food scientists and technologists in industry, research and teaching, especially food process engineers involved in product development, quality assurance, packaging and production.",['Sue Ghazala'],Boom Koninklijke Uitgevers,['Technology & Engineering']
"The Positive Psychology of Buddhism and Yoga, 2nd Edition: Paths to A Mature Happiness",5.0,An Understandable Guide to the Practice of Buddhism,"This book introduces the beliefs and practices of Buddhism and Yoga, and finishes with some practical applications of Buddhist practices including empathic assertiveness, handling anger and taking a problem-solving stance to resolving conflict.Levine is a researcher in experimental psychology. He follows a disciplined, analytic approach in his presentation of Buddhism and Yoga, and has written the book in a practical, teaching format. Divided into 36 short chapters each dealing with a discrete aspect of the teaching and each chapter ends with a set of thought provoking questions ""For Reflection and Discussion"". I found the writing to be unpretentious and clear. He does not revert to flaky arguments, nor ask the reader to accept too much on faith.The book starts by briefly discussing the background and formation of Buddhism and moves on to explain the core of the Buddhist teachings. He includes a useful discussion and comparison of the Yogic doctrines, which have much in common with Buddhism. Levine draws on Buddhist mythology, Western psychology and his own experiences in practicing Buddhism and Yoga to portray a set of practices to develop wisdom and maturity within the individual.I liked the fact that the book is written from an introductory point of view, and that it provides reasons for the Buddhist beliefs and practices with many practical examples of their application in everyday life. I have been able to apply much of what Levine discusses - from how I think about issues, to my motivation in doing things, to how I act towards others. The book includes a good subject index, and a list of bibliographic references and further readings.The only thing I would criticize Levine for was his occasional brief wanderings into theoretical discussion of a point.Though not a ""motivational"" book I found the content very inspirational, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an introduction to the practices and benefits of Buddhism and Yoga, and also to those seeking a comparison of the similarities and differences between Buddhism, Yoga and Western psychology.","In a manner never before published, this book presents both Buddhism and Yoga and relates them to contemporary Western psychology. Although existing books begin with advanced concepts, such as emptiness or egolessness, The Positive Psychology of Buddhism and Yoga begins with very basic concepts and avoids the exotic and so called ""mystical"" notions. Levine emphasizes the goals of Buddhism and Yoga and the methods they employ to achieve those goals. This book is divided into four sections. The first deals with Buddhism, the second with Yoga, and the third describes aims and practices in Western clinical psychology. The fourth section is a workshop on handling anger. The central lesson of the first three sections is that one can improve one's life by changing one's self. This fourth section applies this lesson and the methods of the three preceding sections to handling one's own anger. Overall the book is rich with Eastern tales and illustrative anecdotes. These concrete examples vividly illuminate the general conceptual presentation. Levine shows not only the basic concerns of Buddhism and Yoga and how intensely practical their methods are but how these concerns and methods relate to those of modern Western psychology. Application to daily living is emphasized throughout. The serious reader should start: *to experience less anger, agitation, and stress; *to improve relationships with coworkers, family, and friends; and *to face life's challenges with greater wisdom and strength.",['Marvin Levine'],Psychology Press,['Medical']
Charlie Chan Carries On,5.0,A- entry in A+ series,"Compared with the other entries in the Charlie Chan mystery series, Charlie Chan Carries On is not the strongest; compared with the heap of popular American detective fiction of the past century, it is still pretty darn good, so let's give it an A-.This is the 5th of the six books in the series, published in 1930. Author Biggers took an artistic risk by starting out with a story that belongs to Scotland Yard Inspector Duff, an old friend of Charlie's. A member of an American-based world tour is found murdered in London. The members are wealthy and well-connected and the Embassy releases Duff's circle of suspects to continue on their way. So, he tries with uneven results to keep up. There are more deaths. When the ship arrives at Honolulu, a good 2/3 of the way through the book, Charlie joins what is left of the touring group for the last leg to San Francisco, to fix what went wrong in the investigation up to that point.So, not giving us Charlie's company up front was a risk that was okay but not great. The travel group is large and we have to keep up with several names and stereotypical characters--though by the end, we can keep them straight. Typically, Biggers starts with stereotypes but spins them, but not so much here. The tourists are the 1%ers of 1930, apparently untouched by the events of October 1929, about which Charlie makes a passing remark. Biggers also relies on his own formula that always includes a bright ing&eacute;nue and her suitor. In Behind That Curtain, the ing&eacute;nue broke gender rules left and right; this is more of a predictable screwball comedy couple. All that said, we still get Charlie in the end, and Biggers slyly reveals the state of his contemporary world as he found it.",,['Earl Derr Biggers'],,

Tea Rose,5.0,great read,A great love story! curl up with it and you won't be able to stop until you are finished. love it love it love it love it,"The Tea Rose is a towering old-fashioned story, imbued with a modern sensibility, of a family's destruction, of murder and revenge, of love lost and won again, and of one determined woman's quest to survive and triumph. East London, 1888-a city apart. A place of shadow and light where thieves, whores, and dreamers mingle, where children play in the cobbled streets by day and a killer stalks at night, where bright hopes meet the darkest truths. Here, by the whispering waters of the Thames, a bright and defiant young woman dares to dream of a life beyond tumbledown wharves, gaslit alleys, and the grim and crumbling dwellings of the poor. Fiona Finnegan, a worker in a tea factory, hopes to own a shop one day, together with her lifelong love, Joe Bristow, a costermonger's son. With nothing but their faith in each other to spur them on, Fiona and Joe struggle, save, and sacrifice to achieve their dreams. But Fiona's dreams are shattered when the actions of a dark and brutal man take from her nearly everything-and everyone-she holds dear. Fearing her own death at the dark man's hands, she is forced to flee London for New York. There, her indomitable spirit-and the ghosts of her past-propel her rise from a modest west side shopfront to the top of Manhattan's tea trade.

One for the Money,1.0,"Appalling violence, depressing sexism","I want to add my voice to the minority here who were also shocked by the violence against women in this book, for which I was very unprepared. I started reading it after a couple of people told me how funny the series is. This book goes into my personal hall of fame as one of the few I have chosen not to finish.Any redeeming features of this book, including its so-called &quot;humor&quot;, are entirely mitigated by the full-scale &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; that is so degrading for both the male and female characters. This sexism is present more blatantly in the plot action (encounters with a sexual sadist) and more subtly in the way it infuses the whole narrative. For example, it seems we are supposed to get laughs out of a woman being involuntarily handcuffed naked to a shower rail and being ogled at, and by what happens when young women are too inexperienced to negotiate what they want from their first sexual encounters, and by men and women settling their differences through violence (driving into someone and breaking their leg).It kinda adds to my disappointment that the author is a woman.

The Probable Future (Ballantine Reader's Circle),3.0,An enjoyable lazy-afternoon read,"The Sparrows are a family of women who've lived in a small Massachusetts town since colonial times, their lives enlivened by a magical gift (different for each of them) that first manifests itself on their thirteenth birthdays. As is often the case with magic, the term ""gift"" is applied here fairly loosely. In the present day, Elinor always knows a lie, her daughter Jenny experiences other people's dreams, and granddaughter Stella, just turned thirteen, has developed the ability to see how people will die. The relationship-wrecking potential of the first two gifts is of course blindingly obvious, and the third would be a heavy burden for anyone to bear-especially a thirteen-year-old who's not speaking to the mother who's screwing up their relationship by trying to avoid all of her mother's mistakes.These are well-drawn characters who often inspire, simultaneously, the desire to give them tea and crackers and the desire to knock their heads together. Jenny is completely justified and utterly wrong-headed in her resentment of her mother; so is Stella. Jenny is absolutely correct in having concluded, after having it pounded into her head repeatedly, that Stella's father, Will Avery, is a lying, cheating (...)who can be relied on only to let everyone down. Stella is also right in believing him to be a loving, devoted parent who actually listens to her, which her mother does not.There is a plot in here, involving Stella's gift of seeing deaths accidentally landing Will in jail, charged with murder, but the plot is not the point. The focus of this book is the engaging, and ultimately optimistic, story of the tangled relationships of the Sparrow women and their friends and relations.An enjoyable lazy-afternoon read.","Struggling to cope with her unwanted ability to see the future, Stella must confront her legacy when her father is jailed, wrongly accused of homicide, and Stella joins forces with her grandmother and mother to uncover the truth.",['Alice Hoffman'],Alice Hoffman,['Fiction']

Confessions of an Economic Hitman,5.0,Great read,"This book was very interesting and to an extent educative. The writer's style is simple and for the common reader, not for high academic purpose. My husband is not a reader and read it in a couple of hours.","Shocking Bestseller: The original version of this astonishing tell-all book spent 73 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, has sold more than 1.25 million copies, and has been translated into 32 languages. New Revelations: Featuring 15 explosive new chapters, this expanded edition of Perkins's classic bestseller brings the story of economic hit men (EHMs) up to date and, chillingly, home to the US. Over 40 percent of the book is new, including chapters identifying today's EHMs and a detailed chronology extensively documenting EHM activity since the first edition was published in 2004. Former economic hit man John Perkins shares new details about the ways he and others cheated countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars. Then he reveals how the deadly EHM cancer he helped create has spread far more widely and deeply than ever in the US and everywhere else—to become the dominant system of business, government, and society today. Finally, he gives an insider view of what we each can do to change it. Economic hit men are the shock troops of what Perkins calls the corporatocracy, a vast network of corporations, banks, colluding governments, and the rich and powerful people tied to them. If the EHMs can't maintain the corrupt status quo through nonviolent coercion, the jackal assassins swoop in. The heart of this book is a completely new section, over 100 pages long, that exposes the fact that all the EHM and jackal tools—false economics, false promises, threats, bribes, extortion, debt, deception, coups, assassinations, unbridled military power—are used around the world today exponentially more than during the era Perkins exposed over a decade ago. The material in this new section ranges from the Seychelles, Honduras, Ecuador, and Libya to Turkey, Western Europe, Vietnam, China, and, in perhaps the most unexpected and sinister development, the United States, where the new EHMs—bankers, lobbyists, corporate executives, and others—“con governments and the public into submitting to policies that make the rich richer and the poor poorer.” But as dark as the story gets, this reformed EHM also provides hope. Perkins offers a detailed list of specific actions each of us can take to transform what he calls a failing Death Economy into a Life Economy that provides sustainable abundance for all.",['John Perkins'],Berrett-Koehler Publishers,['Biography & Autobiography']
Michelangelo,5.0,I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!,"While browsing through a local bookstore I chanced upon Michelangelo by Diane Stanley. What a beautiful book! Not only were the pictures captivating, but the information was excellent. Michelangelo's famous picture of the creation of the moon and stars that graces the Sistene chapel is on the cover. My children were enthralled as I read how Michelangelo spent many hours dissecting human cadavers at a local morgue, becoming so familiar with the human body that he was able to make his works come alive with breathtaking detail. I will look for more books by this same author. Children(and adults)will read this book over and over. A great addition to your home library!","The fame and influence of Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564) were as immediate as they were unprecedented. It is not surprising, therefore, that he was the only living artist Giorgio Vasari included in the first edition of Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects, published in 1550. Revised and expanded in 1568, Vasari’s monumental work comprises more than two hundred biographies; for centuries it has been recognized as a seminal text in art history and one of the most important sources on the Italian Renaissance. Vasari’s biography of Michelangelo, the longest in his Lives, presents Michelangelo’s oeuvre as the culminating achievement of Renaissance painting, sculpture, and architecture. He tells the grand story of the artist’s expansive career, profiling his working habits; describing the creation of countless masterpieces, from the David to the Sistine Chapel ceiling; and illuminating his relationships with popes and other illustrious patrons. A lifelong friend, Vasari also quotes generously from the correspondence between the two men; the narrative is further enhanced by an abundance of colorful anecdotes. The volume’s forty-two illustrations convey the range and richness of Michelangelo’s art.

Unlike the majority of Anthony Robbins' books, Dyer doesn't use his own book for promoting seminars and that I find refreshing.

Using tools as varied as archaeo-astronomy, geology, and computer analysis of ancient myths, Graham Hancock presents a compelling case to suggest that it is. “A fancy piece of historical sleuthing . . . intriguing and entertaining and sturdy enough to give a long pause for thought.”—Kirkus Reviews In Fingerprints of the Gods, Hancock embarks on a worldwide quest to put together all the pieces of the vast and fascinating jigsaw of mankind’s hidden past. In ancient monuments as far apart as Egypt’s Great Sphinx, the strange Andean ruins of Tihuanaco, and Mexico’s awe-inspiring Temples of the Sun and Moon, he reveals not only the clear fingerprints of an as-yet-unidentified civilization of remote antiquity, but also startling evidence of its vast sophistication, technological advancement, and evolved scientific knowledge. A record-breaking number one bestseller in Britain, Fingerprints of the Gods contains the makings of an intellectual revolution, a dramatic and irreversible change in the way that we understand our past—and so our future. And Fingerprints of God tells us something more. As we recover the truth about prehistory, and discover the real meaning of ancient myths and monuments, it becomes apparent that a warning has been handed down to us, a warning of terrible cataclysm that afflicts the Earth in great cycles at irregular intervals of time—a cataclysm that may be about to recur. “Readers will hugely enjoy their quest in these pages of inspired storytelling.”—The Times (UK)",['Graham Hancock'],Crown,['Science']

Colossus: How the Corporation Changed America,5.0,"Essays, poems, editorials and company histories","These writings consider the impact on American history and events of the rise of big business, using essays, poems, editorials and company histories to reveal that it's the corporation which has ultimately served as the agent of social change in this country. An intriguing collection of writings provides a different kind of economic and social history: one based on business events.","Big business has been the lever of big change over time in American life, change in economy, society, politics, and the envelope of existence--in work, mores, language, consciousness, and the pace and bite of time. Such is the pattern revealed by this historical mosaic. --From the Preface Weaving historical source material with his own incisive analysis, Jack Beatty traces the rise of the American corporation, from its beginnings in the 17th century through today, illustrating how it has come to loom colossus-like over the economy, society, culture, and politics. Through an imaginative selection of readings made up of historical and contemporary documents, opinion pieces, reportage, biographies, company histories, and scenes from literature, all introduced and explicated by Beatty, Colossus makes a convincing case that it is the American corporation that has been, for good and ill, the primary maker and manager of change in modern America. In this anthology, readers are shown how a developing ""business civilization"" has affected domestic life in America, how labor disputes have embodied a struggle between freedom and fraternity, how corporate leaders have faced the recurring dilemma of balancing fiduciary with social responsibility, and how Silicon Valley and Wall Street have come to dwarf Capitol Hill in pervasiveness of influence. From the slave trade and the transcontinental railroad to the software giants and the multimedia conglomerates, Colossus reveals how the corporation emerged as the foundation of representative government in the United States, as the builder of the young nation's public works, as the conqueror of American space, and as the inexhaustible engine of economic growth from the Civil War to today. At the same time, Colossus gives perspective to the century-old debate over the corporation's place in the good society. A saga of freedom and domination, success and failure, creativity and conformity, entrepreneurship and monopoly, high purpose and low practice, Colossus is a major historical achievement.",['Jack Beatty'],Currency,['Business & Economics']

The Italian Boy: A Tale of Murder and Body Snatching in 1830s London,4.0,"Intriguing history of murder, bodysnatching 1830's London.","Before the passage of the 1830's Anatomy Act that allowed medical schools legal usage of bodies of the unclaimed poor, grave robbing was a common occurrence in London and the surrounding countryside. Resurrection men were known to raid newly dug graves and sell the bodies to medical schools for dissection purposes. If a resurrection man was good at his trade he often made more money pedaling the bodies of the dead than the average laborer. Due to the medical establishment's demand for fresh bodies usually outpaced the supply it wasn't uncommon for individuals to be murdered for their bodies.THE ITALIAN BOY thoroughly examines the notorious crimes of three London resurrection men who were charged with the murder of a young Italian street performer in November 1831. Sarah Wise performs a good job in bringing to life this period of London's history that was full of social and political transformations. Although many of the passages pertaining to the trail were dry, there are enough tidbits of social history to make reading this book more than worthwhile. The descriptions of the police investigations and the infancy of forensic knowledge were interesting, along with everyday descriptions of 1830's London.The lure of reading books about the underbelly of life in 19th century London is always difficult for me to resist; if you also enjoy this subject matter then this book will give you a satisfying fix to cure your cravings. 4.5 stars. Recommended.","A thrilling history of England's great metropolis at a point of great change, told through the story of a young vagrant murdered by ""resurrection men"" Before his murder in 1831, the ""Italian boy"" was one of thousands of orphans on the streets of London, moving among the livestock, hawkers, and con men, begging for pennies. When his body was sold to a London medical college, the suppliers were arrested for murder. Their high-profile trial would unveil London's furtive trade in human corpses carried out by body-snatchers--or ""resurrection men""--who killed to satisfy the first rule of the cadaver market: the fresher the body, the higher the price. Historian Sarah Wise reconstructs not only the boy's murder but the chaos and squalor of London that swallowed the fourteen-year-old vagrant long before his corpse appeared on the slab. In 1831, the city's poor were desperate and the wealthy were petrified, the population swelling so fast that old class borders could not possibly hold. All the while, early humanitarians were pushing legislation to protect the disenfranchised, the courts were establishing norms of punishment and execution, and doctors were pioneering the science of human anatomy. Vivid and intricate, The Italian Boy restores to history the lives of the very poorest Londoners and offers an unparalleled account of the sights, sounds, and smells of a city at the brink of a major transformation.",['Sarah Wise'],Metropolitan Books,['History']

Cobra Event,5.0,Pete,"One of the best books I've ever read, and I've read tons. The plot and characters are very realistic. The story moves along without getting bogged down at any point. And the ending is satisfying.","The Cobra Event is set in motion one spring morning in New York City, when a seventeen-year-old student wakes up feeling vaguely ill. Hours later she is having violent seizures, blood is pouring out of her nose, and she has begun a hideous process of self-cannibalization. Soon, other gruesome deaths of a similar nature have been discovered, and the Centers for Disease Control sends a forensic pathologist to investigate. What she finds precipitates a federal crisis. The details of this story are fictional, but they are based on a scrupulously thorough inquiry into the history of biological weapons and their use by civilian and military terrorists. Richard Preston's sources include members of the FBI and the United States military, public health officials, intelligence officers in foreign governments, and scientists who have been involved in the testing of strategic bioweapons. The accounts of what they have seen and what they expect to happen are chilling.

OF MICE AND MEN,4.0,"""I'm sorry George""","Of Mice and Men is a story about two travelers that are trying to make their dream come true. The main charters in this book are, George Milton and Lennie Small. Both are the run because of an incident that happened in the town Weed. George and Lennie travel to get work so they can one day save up enough money to buy a piece of land and reach their goal. One thing that Lennie likes to do in this book is to pet soft things. He likes soft animals especially rabbits. Lennie is mentally retarded so he doesn't really know what is right and wrong. Lennie gets himself into lots of trouble throughout this book.My favorite character in this book is George Milton because he gets Lennie out of trouble. George helps Lennie all the way through their adventure and that is a true friend by your side.I could relate to George because when it comes to a good friend like he is with Lennie I'm there for my friends. George helps Lennie a lot through this book by sticking up for him and keeping him out of trouble. I have always saved my friends when they were trouble just like George does with Lennie. I help my friends when they need it the most. George helps Lennie when he gets in trouble in the town of Weed. I am just like George in a way because of how good of a friend he is to Lennie and how I am the same with my friends.This is a great book, but it is sad near the end. You can foresee a lot of things while reading this novel. My favorite part in the book was when Lennie is getting punched in the face by Curly; George then tells Lennie to fight back. Lennie then grabs Curly's hand with one fist and crushes it. The part that I least liked in the book was when Carlson shot Candy's dog to put it out of it's misery because Carlson said the dog smelled. Carlson had no right to shoot Candy's dog even if he did wanted to put it out of it's misery. I would change the part where Lennie got involved with Curly's wife. This is when things leads to trouble.I would recommend this book to others because it is a great book. This book has everything, drama, action and lots more. I think any type of person would read this novel mostly because of the story, characters and the qualities that it has. Over all this is the best novel that I have read in years and I suggest others should read this book and enjoy.","A controversial tale of friendship and tragedy during the Great Depression A Penguin Classic Over seventy-five years since its first publication, Steinbeck’s tale of commitment, loneliness, hope, and loss remains one of America’s most widely read and taught novels. An unlikely pair, George and Lennie, two migrant workers in California during the Great Depression, grasp for their American Dream. They hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations, nor predict the consequences of Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things George taught him. Of Mice and Men represents an experiment in form, which Steinbeck described as “a kind of playable novel, written in a novel form but so scened and set that it can be played as it stands.” A rarity in American letters, it achieved remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films. This edition features an introduction by Susan Shillinglaw, one of today’s leading Steinbeck scholars.

The Mysterious Affair at Styles,4.0,Different Detective Novel,This book required learning new characters and a new dectective for me. I found it entertaining and the ending satisfying if not typical.I would recommend it to any Agatha Christie fan. Good read.,"Agatha Christie’s first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, was the result of a dare from her sister Madge who challenged her to write a story. The story begins when Hastings is sent back to England from the First World War due to injury and is invited to spend his sick leave at the beautiful Styles Court by his old friend John Cavendish. Here, Hastings meets John’s stepmother, Mrs. Inglethorp, and her new husband, Alfred. Despite the tranquil surroundings Hastings begins to realize that all is not right. When Mrs. Inglethorp is found poisoned, suspicion falls on the family, and another old friend, Hercule Poirot, is invited to investigate. Agatha Christie’s first-ever murder mystery. With impeccable timing, Hercule Poirot, the renowned Belgian detective, makes his dramatic entrance onto the English crime stage. Recently, there had been some strange goings-on at Styles St Mary. Evelyn, the constant companion to old Mrs. Inglethorp, had stormed out of the house muttering something about ‘a lot of sharks’. And with her, something indefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt security; now the air seemed rife with suspicion and impending evil. A shattered coffee cup, a splash of candle grease, a bed of begonias... all Poirot required to display his now legendary powers of detection.",['Agatha Christie'],BEYOND BOOKS HUB,['Fiction']
Jane Eyre (Simple English),5.0,Jane Eyre,ordered on my Kindle and it was a reread of a book I had read many years ago and I enjoyed reading it again as much as I did the first time. I enjoy the older books better than most of the new ones.,"Jane Eyre, aged 10, lives at Gateshead Hall with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle's dying wish. Jane was orphaned several years earlier when her parents died of typhus. Mr. Reed, Jane's uncle, was the only member of the Reed family who was ever kind to Jane. Jane's aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her, abuses her, and treats her as a burden, and Mrs. Reed discourages her three children from associating with Jane. Jane, as a result, becomes defensive against her cruel judgement. The nursemaid, Bessie, proves to be Jane's only ally in the household, even though Bessie occasionally scolds Jane harshly. Excluded from the family activities, Jane leads an unhappy childhood, with only a doll and books with which to entertain herself.One day, as punishment for defending herself against her cousin John Reed, Jane is relegated to the red room in which her late uncle had died; there, she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his ghost. The red room is significant because it lays the grounds for the ""ambiguous relationship between parents and children"" which plays out in all of Jane's future relationships with male figures throughout the novel.",['Charlotte Brontë'],,

Tracks in the Sea: Matthew Fontaine Maury and the Mapping of the Oceans,5.0,American Hero,"Mr. Hearn's splendid account of the life of the self-taught Matthew Maury is one that should be read by anyone with the remotest interest in sailing or the industrial revolution. He should also be of interest to those who want a concrete account of the benefits of &quot;data-mining&quot; in which miscellaneous, disparate sources of information are aggregated into something which is tremendously useful.Maury took crates of old ship logs, and extracted the data about weather and currents as a function of date and location, and produced ingenious maps of the sea that could be used to plot voyages that minimized the time of passage. In the age of the American clipper ships, the time saved could be quite substantial, even amounting to as much as factor of two over the haphazard routes used by the intuitive captains of the day.The reduction of the data and the production of the maps was carried out by only a handful of men at the U.S. Naval Observatory, but produced tremendous economic advantages to those who used them. They were quickly adopted by the merchant marine, and by cleverly requiring the recipients of the latest maps to turn over to him logs taken in a standard format, he was able to gather tons of new data for ever-improving successive maps. Maury also discovered the feasibility for the route of the first transatlantic cable, and fought to establish the first weather bureau in the US.He also brought about the convening of a Brussels Marine meteorology Conference in 1853 that was attended by nine countries and resulted in the adoption of a uniform method of gathering and disseminating the information among the world. Not bad for a simple Lieutenant! His quarrels with the jealous Joseph Henry (of electromagnetic induction fame) and others of his ilk are instructive to those interested in stories of how pettiness and obstructionism of powerful men can be overcome by men of true ability.This story is well researched and ably told by Mr. Hearn, and is another exciting adventure of the heroes who made the industrial revolution.","A great story of discovery and adventure in the tradition of Longitude Maritime navigation remained largely a matter of guesswork until well into the 19th century, and making a voyage meant following a series of all-too-often disastrous hunches. Changing that became the lifelong obsession of the brilliant, irascible geographer Matthew Fontaine Maury, whose career both aided and mirrored America's rise as a maritime power. With his controversial appointment as the first superintendent of the U.S. Naval Observatory in 1840, he at last found his life's work. While others built railroads across the trackless interior, Maury mapped the highways of wind and current over the previously trackless sea. In Tracks in the Sea, Chester G. Hearn uses Maury's career as a window on the 19th century, including the brief but glorious clipper-ship era of the 1850s, the rise of steam and steel, the Civil War and the destruction of the U.S. merchant fleet, and the points of intersection with some of the most colorful and influential people of the time, including presidents, congressmen, military leaders, scientists, explorers, merchants, and writers.",['Chester G.

Witches Abroad (Discworld),5.0,Absolutely hysterical,"I'll be honest. I was not previously a huge fan of the witches in the Discworld books and was not looking forward to reading this. But since I'm currently engaged in reading or rereading all of the Discworld books, skipping this was not an option. Luckily I was absolutely delighted with this book and, in fact, found it to be as funny as any of the earlier novels in the series. As usual, Pratchett shows almost endless inventiveness in telling the story of a witch who is recruited to be a Fairy Godmother and the two older witches who were manipulated into helping her. And also as usual, Pratchett does a brilliant job of sending up a host of other stories, in this one CINDERELLA in particular but several others along the way. In fact, this one is in part about an evil witch, one who uses mirrors, who wants to use stories to conquer the world. Therefore almost all key moments in the story end up having resonances with other stories.I liked this one so much that it is one of the novels in the series that I would recommend to newcomers to the Discworld. Unless, like I am now, you want to read all of the books in order, this is a splendid first taste of the best delights that the novels have to offer. It is a book that offers a string of truly funny and even hysterical moments and Pratchett's prose is as sharp as ever. And of course, some of his finest characters manage to put in token appearances, such as (of course) Death and the Librarian. Even Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibler manages to appear in one of his many guises as the author of a self-defense program.Terry Pratchett is one of the great gifts of our age to the world.

Kon-tiki: Across the Pacific by raft (A Keith Jennison book),4.0,I now want to sail across the Pacific!,"Although the middle part of this book drags (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), I was really satisfied when I finished reading this book. I was on vacation in Oslo and had visited the Kon-Tiki museum. I had never heard of Thor Heyerdahl before, but from what I saw at the museum, I was very fascinated and intrigued by the story of his trip across the Pacific on a balsa-wood raft. The week I came home I immediately started reading this book, and I was not disappointed. I was really fascinated by the accounts of interaction with sea animals, whales, sharks, dolphins, etc. that I immediately wanted to go sailing on a wide open sea in order to see all these exotic animals that Heyerdahl and his crew encountered.

From whores and highwaymen to courtiers and noblemen, from events such as the Great Plague and the Fire of London to the intimate passions of ordinary—and extraordinary—men and women, Amber experiences it all. But throughout her trials and escapades, she remains, in her heart, true to the one man she really loves, the one man she can never have. Frequently compared to Gone with the Wind, Forever Amber is the other great historical romance, outselling every other American novel of the 1940s—despite being banned in Boston for its sheer sexiness.

I came away with many things after I was done. The detailed way in which Franklin covers his material (what material he does cover in the broken narrative) must be a delight for historians. Moreover, I found that Franklin's personality shone so strongly through the text that I had to laugh out loud on several occasions.I gave the book four stars because I found that the other writings included were a bit stingy. Some were so delightful (&quot;Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress&quot;) and the period that's not covered by the autobiography is so large, that I think a wider selection would have been helpful.","An edition with a new introduction presents readers with a wide-ranging selection of Benjamin Franklin's most important writings, illuminating the complex and appealing character of this quintessential American who rose to fame as a publisher, inventor, educator, bon vivant and statesman.

Nineteen Eighty-four,5.0,Finished Wanting More,"George Orwells 1984 is by far my favoirte book of all time. As of last year you would have to pay me to read , but my first year of highschool seemed to be a real slap in the face. We read over14books this year. Most i would read only because i had to , but with 1984 something was differnt. I read 1984 with full intrest until the very last word. The basis of the story was all i needed , all the added details were just one of the many bonuses. These days people are so concerned with their reputations in society that no one will stand up for what they believe in .

Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (Barron's Book Notes),5.0,home again,"This is in response to the readers that did not like the quality of the hardcover book. They seemed to feel that a 50th anniversary deserved a slicker presentation.However for me, the book is perfect (story and paper quality). As soon as I opened the box, I felt that I was 9 years old and staring at the bookcase that divided ourliving room from the kitchen. I often spent time searching the bulging shelves for a book to keep me company on the long, hot days in Austin, Texas. I spot a newaddition on the bottom shelf. It's not very impressive in contrast with the picture books of travel and natural wonders that I use as my guide to adventure.The book is small and the colors on the dust jacket are drab. The pages are thick, dull and pulpy; like so many novels were printed on in the 1950's an 1960's.There are absolutely no pictures or photographs in the whole book. This alone usually would have doomed the book. Yet, the Texas weather compels me to find a literarycompanion. Outside no breeze stirs. The air is heavy with moisture.

Slaughterhouse-Five : Or the Children's Crusade,5.0,A story with a conscience,"Kurt Vonnegut is, I'm told, a pacifist. While there are elements of pacifism that make terrific sense to me, I'm not sure I completely join him in this particular conviction. In Slaughterhouse Five, however, he makes a brilliant case for his position.Slaughterhouse Five is about war. And tragedy. And laughter. And aliens. It's not really a true story, but it's set in a true piece of history... the infamous firebombing of Dresden in the final months of World War II. Vonnegut draws on his own, true experiences as a soldier in Dresden to inform the fiction.While Vonnegut is famous for his sense of humor, that wasn't what was most impressive to me about this particular work. I appreciated this book because it has a conscience. While many authors are content to woo or shock or report, Vonnegut feels a deep sense of responsibility to his audience to not only tell the story... but to wrestle with the questions of time and mortality with his readers.","A special fiftieth anniversary edition of Kurt Vonnegut’s masterpiece, “a desperate, painfully honest attempt to confront the monstrous crimes of the twentieth century” (Time), featuring a new introduction by Kevin Powers, author of the National Book Award finalist The Yellow Birds Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time Slaughterhouse-Five, an American classic, is one of the world’s great antiwar books. Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber’s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming “unstuck in time.” An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut’s writing—the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit—that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O’Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut’s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as “the kind of writer who made people—young people especially—want to write.” George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be “the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.” Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era’s uncertainties. “Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.”—The Boston Globe",['Kurt Vonnegut'],Dial Press Trade Paperback,['Fiction']

No book has helped me to appreciate the Atonement of Jesus Christ more, besides the scriptures themselves. His step-by-step explanation of what constitutes sin, the importance of recognizing it, the necessity of NOT rationalizing it away, taking responsibility and making restitution, (and other important points) literally helped me to see where my life needed changing and how I should go about making those changes.If you love the scriptures and want to follow Christ, and be as much like him in your daily actions as possible, and if you want to rid yourself of the baggage of sin, this book may just be the book you need to read next.",,['Spencer W.

Communication Systems,1.0,Very poorly written text.,"I currently use this text in an introductory course to communication systems. I find the text very porrly written with large numbers of errors. The errors are sometimes easy to spot and sometimes rather difficult to find. My professor many times stumbles over the errors. Sometimes it's a battle to understand the examples worked out in the text. A good example of the extent of the errors can be found on page 109 where the authors claim that 35 + 55 - 199.1 + 20 equals -144.1. I thought that such addition was taught in 1st and 2nd grade. A second example is much harder to find such as the + sign instead of a - sign in example 3.5-1 on page 122. I could go on and on with several more examples of egregious errors, but there's not enough room to fit them all. I have written letters to my dean, the editors, and the publisher stating that this book is riddled with many many errors and should be immediately pulled from course materials and publications. If anyone writes a positive review of this book they are either lying, incompetent themselves or had a very good professor who could help them past the errors in the book or avoided using the text as much as possible. If you have a professor who is using this book I recommend you either drop the course or see if the professor is willing to change the text material.",,,,

Farnham's Freehold,2.0,Had much potential...,"Robert Heinlein has his fans--of which I'm becoming--and is obviously considered a legendary writer, but sometimes even a ""legend"" has some bad books, or at least, books that have had potential.""The Door Through Summer"" was a book that had a definitive goal and obstacles, where some of the books by Heinlein are just people going through the motions with no clear goal, until maybe the final third where there is a plot the protagonist has to face until he or she realizes some life-changing matter. (Note: These are books I obviously don't see myself returning to).""Farnham's Freehold"" wasn't a book to have a definitive goal, I discovered after reading it, but it did offer some ideas that I found intriguing, which initially drew me to the novel. That idea is a planet that has a majority of ""people of color"" (i.e. of African descent). Hugh, the Caucasian hero, also doubles as the audience as he is thrust into ""foreign"" world he isn't used to, {coming from the racially charged 1960s). For most of the book, it's about Hugh and his family, their squabbles, and it's not until their discovery of a different world that a plot to escape (in the final third of the novel) hits. And, it's not necessarily that big of an obstacle, since they are let free anyhow to go back to a time where they are comfortable.Of note, this world is devoid of any Asians, specifically Chinese. The reason for this is the generalization that their skin is ""white,"" which in turn generalizes all Asians, since there are different shades of Asians...and not all Asians are from China. The ""Asians"" were killed off in the initial battle that led up to the predominant black/white civilizations. Interestingly, Hindu individuals, in Heinlein's story, are considered closer to ""black"" due to their skin tone--again, generalizations--since Hindus are Asian, and even ""black"" people have different shades.The world is devoid of anyone who is non-white Hispanic/Latino, or Native American. All we know is that there is a black civilization over a white subclass, and the black leader is a cannibal...eating teenage white girls.There are no dimensions to the black ruling class Hugh and his family meet. Heinlein could have pushed further with this world, as we really don't learn much or care by the end of the novel.** out of *****","You Would Have Peace Then Prepare for War!

Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,4.0,"Excellent.

It delighted me in it's simple pursuit of truth with it's arguments skillfully presented in metaphor. I felt that it stood head &amp; shoulders above most of the sophomoric propaganda being touted at the time. I was extremely surprised to read some of the negative reviews printed here.

Her mother, unable to cope with the humiliation, committed suicide, leaving Sarah to grow up with an ""aunt"" in New Orleans. She returns to Maine upon discovery of her father's body, which is found at the bottom of a lake outside town. Sara insists the bank heist investigation be re-opened. She also plans to avenge the devastation that the town brought to her family. Her first love, Chicago nightclub owner Tony returns to stand by her, something he failed to do 20 years earlier. But someone would rather see Sarah dead then the past revisited.Overall, the plot is a bit thin and somewhat predictable; I guessed the bad guy early on (a rare occurrence for me). But Sala always creates such engaging characters, and despite its predictability, I found it to be an interesting story.","In the New York Times–bestselling author’s tale of romantic suspense, a woman returns home to find her father’s killer and gets caught in a web of deceit. Twenty years ago, Sarah Whitman’s father Frank disappeared from Marmet, Maine, after stealing a fortune from the local bank, leaving his wife and daughter to face the town’s vitriol.

The author does an excellent job portraying the characters from Benedict Arnold to Burgoyne and the rest. I enjoyed most his depiction of what living in the New York/Vermont area was like. It was the frontier; settlers were still subject to Indian attack. The logistical challenges for both sides were also masterfully presented, from moving guns, getting food, to exchanging messages.","In the summer of 1777 (twelve months after the Declaration of Indepence) the British launched an invasion from Canada under General John Burgoyne.

Relative to reading history books on the topic in class, this account gives you a true sense for how amazing and brave those who took part in this movement are. Despite the massive injustice of the period, these inspiring people, held fast to non-violent protest.I was amazed by careful mental training that people underwent to enter into protest. MLK describes the need for these individuals to be certain that they could react to physical violence without retaliation. I consider how quick the average person is to react to the most minor of slights in today's daily life. It makes you realize that training to fight is so much easier than training not to fight.It was intriguing how they constructed the movement, standing fast despite the laws and pressures. Leaders had multiple opportunities to ""get out easily"". Yet, they held fast together in solidarity.

""Our colonial period coincided with the period of revolution and readjustment in England, referred to in the preceding chapter, when the British merchant-State was displacing the feudal State, consolidating its own position, and shifting the incidence of economic exploitation.""There is a huge discrepancy between the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution itself. Individual rights get shown the door along with the King of England. Nock goes out of his way to explain the history of this, its origins, and its ramifications. The end result is that The State always acts towards the benefit of growing the state-merchantilist powers at the expense of the people. This is the very nature of our Constitution and Nock uses a systematic and historical method to prove it.This book is a classic. If you really have an interest in understanding the origins of our political foundation, and why it cannot be reformed, changed, reduced, or otherwise ""fixed"" by more government, Nock puts forth a compelling explanation. This book is overlooked and underrated. I cannot recommend it more strongly.",,,Ludwig von Mises Institute,['Political science']
Jesus Land: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards)),5.0,Definitely Recommend Scheeres' Memoir,"Julia Scheeres' Jesus Land is a memoir that takes the reader through a childhood spent in abusive environments and into the mind of a child trying to cope with these circumstances. The first half of the book is set in Scheeres' childhood home in rural Indiana, and the second part takes us to a religious reform school in the Dominican Republic where she does time alongside her brother David. As the white sister of two black adopted brothers, Scheeres' witnesses the disparity in treatment that they receive, both in punishment and in routine treatment. Together, Julia and her brother David endure a physically abusive father, racist classmates, and a mother that is totally disconnected from their existence.Scheeres' portrait of both herself and her brother David account for the only two sympathetic characters in the story. It is easy to feel sorry for the life that David leads, as a black boy in rural (read: racist) Indiana, and to understand the plight of the author as well. Most readers will recognize pieces of themselves in these two as they read about their struggle for acceptance at their high school and as they fight against the world as two people united as brother and sister.As Scheeres intimates in the book's question and answer section, she chose the title ""because the book deals in specious facades, like the amusement park."" This theme of using religion to mask inner family turmoil may appeal to the reader because (a) it is something they recognize from their own upbringing or (b) they may be interested in exploring this topic after reading about it elsewhere. Either way, it is a familiar theme that pops up in modern day politics and often drives the narrative that the religious right pushes upon the American conversation: ""Embracing religion will allow you to solve all your problems."" Readers who are not prepared to deal with the idea that one can be both devout and abusive, may not appreciate the theme. Readers interested in themes of discrimination and accounts of religiosity gone wrong will appreciate this book.On a social note, this memoir was published in 2005 and brought a lot of attention to the way that the reform school was being run. The author is part of an online community of alumni that brought the abuses to light and prompted a change in ownership. The school is now known as Caribbean Mountain Academy, owned by a company called Lifeline, and still employs many of the staff that was in place before the ownership change. (Read more about that project here: [...])The author is a journalist living in San Francisco who has previously written for the Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle, New York Times, and Wired.","""A page turner...heart–stopping and enraging...focused, justified, and without a trace of self–pity. Shot through with poignancy."" —New York Times Book Review Over a decade after its first publication, Jesus Land remains deeply resonant with readers. Now with a new preface by the author, this New York Times bestselling memoir is a gripping tale of rage and redemption, hope and humor, morality and malice—and most of all, the truth: that being a good person takes more than just going to church. Julia and her adopted brother, David, are sixteen years old. Julia is white. David is black. It is the mid–1980s and their family has just moved to rural Indiana, a landscape of cottonwood trees, trailer parks, and an all–encompassing racism. At home are a distant mother—more involved with her church's missionaries than her own children—and a violent father. In this riveting and heartrending memoir Julia Scheeres takes us from the Midwest to a place beyond imagining. Surrounded by natural beauty, Escuela Caribe—a religious reform school in the Dominican Republic—is characterized by a disciplinary regime that extracts repentance from its students by any means necessary. Julia and David strive to make it through these ordeals and their tale is relayed here with startling immediacy, extreme candor, and wry humor.",['Julia Scheeres'],Catapult,['Biography & Autobiography']
Kaplan GRE Exam 2004,3.0,"Helpful, but not perfect","This book does a decent job of managing the balance between techniques and content. However, its explanations of many math concepts are lacking. Though the practice tests are scored using an unrealistically difficult scale, they are still valuable when used in conjunction with the ETS PowerPrep software.","For the more than 415,000 students who take the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) annually, Kaplan's proven test-taking strategies offer an effective approach to this challenging exam.","['Kaplan, Inc']",Kaplan,['Study Aids']
The Guide to Owning a Finch,3.0,The book was informative but I feel it left out vital info,It was a good all around book(if you own various types of finches)and it was somewhat informative but vary vauge in the information that it did include. It is not a very good investment if you are looking for more of an educated outlook on the care and breeding of a certain group or type of finch.I would only recomend this book to the beginer because the more experienced bird keepers/breeders should already know all of this information.,"Discusses the selection, accommodation, feeding, breeding, and care of the finch, and includes information on avian classification",['R Fischer'],Turtleback Books,['Pets']
Gerald's Game,4.0,great book- very well written-but totally not typical King,"This is a duty book...Stop laughing. What I mean is that it is a fine book with fine writing and talks about extremely serious subjects in our world. To me I call this kind of thing a duty book/movie/show/artical etc. Like it's my duty to check out some of the common most negative things going on. Ever not enjoy the news, but watch it anyway? Ever watch a family law episode that disgusted you but you still felt urged to watch? That's what I'm talking about. And this book is seriously articulate in describing one of the most common horrors in the world today- rape and child molestation. I won't lie- you will not enjoy this book if you are a normal, sane human being. However it was still a great story and I didn't find it boring at all. It wasn't all climactic I'll grant you, but it was extremely interesting. The monster supposedly made of shadows, the common couple that loses the lust in their love life, what happens to people who were abused as children, dysfunctional families, freak accidents during intense moments, trusting intuition though you could be wrong, it's all in here. No doubt this probably wasn't really fun or exciting for SK to write mostly, but a duty to obey the issues and stories that popped into his mind. Also there are some big surprises here. There may have been a hole or two in the story, but in a nasty and wicked way, this is still a great piece of quality work from Stephen King. But once again- very interesting brain food- not enjoyable or entertaining though, nothing sugary here. Hope that helped.","Now a Netflix movie directed by Mike Flanagan (Oculus, Hush) and starring Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood. Master storyteller Stephen King presents this classic, terrifying #1 New York Times bestseller. When a game of seduction between a husband and wife ends in death, the nightmare has only begun… “And now the voice which spoke belonged to no one but herself. Oh my God, it said. Oh my God, I am all alone out here. I am all alone.” Once again, Jessie Burlingame has been talked into submitting to her husband Gerald’s kinky sex games—something that she’s frankly had enough of, and they never held much charm for her to begin with. So much for a “romantic getaway” at their secluded summer home. After Jessie is handcuffed to the bedposts—and Gerald crosses a line with his wife—the day ends with deadly consequences. Now Jessie is utterly trapped in an isolated lakeside house that has become her prison—and comes face-to-face with her deepest, darkest fears and memories. Her only company is that of the various voices filling her mind…as well as the shadows of nightfall that may conceal an imagined or very real threat right there with her…",['Stephen King'],Simon and Schuster,['Fiction']
DADDY-LONG-LEGS,4.0,captivating,"This book first intrigued me as my daughters and I started to read it together, each one of us consecutively reading Jerusha Abbot's letters. I couldn't stop my desire to finish the book on my own. I can only highly recommend this book to anyone beyond the age of 8. The format is quite unusual and very visually evocative. I think it offers a truly valuable set of lessons on human nature, whether it be the importance of education, the need for financial independence or gender equality. It also happens to be a captivating story from a pure literary standpoint.","One of the great novels of American girlhood, Jean Webster's Daddy-Long-Legs follows the adventures of an orphan named Judy Abbott, whose letters to her anonymous male benefactor trace her development as an independent thinker and writer.",['Jean Webster'],Independently Published,['Fiction']
Cat's Cradle,5.0,His best,"Cat's Cradle is by far Vonnegut's best work. For years I preferred Slaughterhouse Five, but after rereading Cradle this month, I'm now of the opinion that if you're going to read any Vonnegut, this is the one.","“A free-wheeling vehicle . . . an unforgettable ride!”—The New York Times Cat’s Cradle is Kurt Vonnegut’s satirical commentary on modern man and his madness. An apocalyptic tale of this planet’s ultimate fate, it features a midget as the protagonist, a complete, original theology created by a calypso singer, and a vision of the future that is at once blackly fatalistic and hilariously funny. A book that left an indelible mark on an entire generation of readers, Cat’s Cradle is one of the twentieth century’s most important works—and Vonnegut at his very best. “[Vonnegut is] an unimitative and inimitable social satirist.”—Harper’s Magazine “Our finest black-humorist . . . We laugh in self-defense.”—Atlantic Monthly",['Kurt Vonnegut'],Dial Press,['Fiction']
THE CATCHER IN THE RYE,5.0,Classic,"I first bought this book when i was fifteen because i had heard it was meant to be shocking. I flicked through it looking for sex or violence, found none and so discarded it. However when at eighteen, feeling directionless, disillusioned and sick of human nature and the fakeness of it all, i picked this book up and read it properly i was blown away. Holden Caulfield is an incredible character that seems to summarize all aspects of the hardship of going into adulthood. Fiery and outspoken yet tired of falseness and often depressed Holden Caulfield is a brilliantly drawn character. And the book is shocking but not on a cheap, shallow level. This is reccomended reading for all young adults, infact anyone.","Anyone who has read J. D. Salinger's New Yorker stories - particularly A Perfect Day for Bananafish, Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut, The Laughing Man, and For Esme - With Love and Squalor, will not be surprised by the fact that his first novel is full of children. The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep.",['J.D. Salinger'],"Little, Brown",['Fiction']
Fifth Daughter,5.0,"Not your standard romance novel, life is more complicated!","I just finished reading this book and opened my Amazon file to see if I could find more by this author. This is the first book I have read by Ms. Coffman and the style of writing intrigues me. This is definitely not your standard romance novel.Characterization is indirect and we are given insight into the characters thoughts and confusion. My experience in my only really serious relationship is very similar to the description here. I grew up in North Dakota and my best childhood friend and neighbor was the man I later married. For most of my childhood, he was between a friend and a brother to me. He is the first boy I saw naked, he told me where babies came from, and he is literally in every important memory of my childhood. If my experience is not unique (and afterall there is nothing new under the sun), Merisa's confusion is very real. There was an element of incestousness about this kind of relationship. Like Merisa, I could not understand what I felt and denied that I cared (loved) him as a lover for a long time. He figured it out much earlier.Like the main character, I also bounced around in confusion from one relationship to another with men. And like the main character, I kept coming back to my ""friend"" for solace when each of the relationships foundered. I knew those men weren't right for me, but couldn't figure out why. I just had no room for another man but I couldn't admit it even to myself. If I confessed my feelings I might lose my best childhood friend. If he didn't feel the same, would I lose him totally? Would we be embarassed to see each other? It was so confusing that I spent a lot of time frantic with confusion and self disgust, I honestly couldn't understand what was wrong with me. This is the relationship that is described in The Fifth Daughter. I think that only someone who has experienced this sort of love can understand this book.Our relationship was finally able to go forward after some heartbreaking years of separation and confusion (and the death of my own father.) In Merisa's case, she had to be totally separated from her culture and out of space to see the truth of it.Another book with a similar theme is The Annunciation by Ellen Gilchrist. I think she was awarded the National Book Award although I don't know if it was for that book. Love is not all straightforward and clear. If you feel it and feel it isn't right, it can take a very tortuous path.","The Fifth Daughter is a stunning new love story that sweeps from the somber moors of Yorkshire to the Tuscan hills of sunny Italy. Born of tragedy and nurtured by scandal, Maresa Fairweather was a fifth daughter, all but abandoned by her widower father. Wild and headstrong, she was fortunate to have Percy Bronwell to keep her from harm's way. Now the childhood friends have grown up, but realizing his love for Maresa is unrequited, Percy enlists in the Royal Navy. Always attracted to the wrong man, Maresa continues her flirtatious ways until increasing gossip dictates a change of scene. She travels to Italy, but old habits are hard to break and, desperate to end another engagement, she pleads for Percy's help. He saves her the only way he can—by offering a marriage of convenience. After only one night together, Percy returns to his naval command…and Maresa becomes the woman she was destined to be. Learning that Percy's life is in danger at the hands of the French, she risks her own life to save him—and to give him something he has always given her: unwavering love.

Beware the Night,1.0,I'm glad this cop doesn't walk my beat,"I cannot believe this piece of zealout-fueled tripe ever saw print. What's worse I read it. Worse yet, I paid to read it. The back cover of this book proclaims &quot;HELL IS HIS BEAT&quot; what they should have proclaimed was &quot;HELL IS READING HIS BOOK&quot;. There is absolutely nothing about this book that is not dreadful and I mean that in a BAD way.Ralph Sarchie is a New York City cop as well as being an absurdly gullible &quot;demonologist&quot;. This guy writes like he types with his toes. Full of righteous self-indulgence Sargeant Sarchie refers to his career with the NYPD as &quot;the Job&quot; and gallumphing after mystical entities is called &quot;the Work&quot; ad nauseum. When he isn't flexing his machismo at us he's dashing five-gallon jugs of holy water all about, clipping St. Benedict medals to any available animal and mumbling exorcisms at empty closets and surly drunks.The &quot;EIGHT PAGES OF SPECTACULAR PHOTOS&quot; ? Four of the pages contain only family snapshots. One page is of a church interior and a photo of a bishop. So far, a veritable festival of the non-spectacular. Two pages contain photos of graffiti, a photo of a chicken in recent good health and a fake skull. The last page exhibits a blurry and most unflattering photo of his sister, (think John Lennon needing a shave) and what the author would like us to think is an orb in motion. It also includes a picture of what looks to be a giant white blob of masticated gum photoshopped onto a photo of a sidewalk. You can see more interesting images if you just sit in a dark room and punch yourself hard in the eye.If masochists had a book club this would be at the top of the reading list.","On the island of Bellona, they worship the sun.

Her close friendship with Nico is Veda’s one saving grace in a cruel world where the division between her people and the ruling Dogio is as wide and winding as the canals that snake through their island.
